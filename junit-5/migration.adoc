=== From 4 to 5

You have Vintage and Jupiter running side by side.

Now you're wondering:

* Is JUnit 4 still supported?
* Do I have to migrate old tests?
* Will I use Jupiter for all new tests?

The answers will surprise you!

=== Is JUnit 4 supported?

Officially, yes:

[quote, 'https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4[JUnit 5 user guide]']
____
[T]he JUnit team will continue to provide maintenance and bug fix releases for the JUnit 4.x baseline
____

=== Is JUnit 4 supported?

But:

(Commits from 07/2017 to 07/2018 - note the y-axis!)

Last release: +
4 Dec 2014.

=== Is JUnit 4 supported?

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Doesn't matter, though:

* it's not security relevant
* it does a very good job
* it's very stable

⇝ Unless you're waiting for important bug-fixes +
or new features, JUnit 4 is doing just fine!

=== Migrating old tests

My view on the matter:

* no reason to migrate running tests
* consider migrating tests that are +
edited because of code changes
* be careful about runners and rules!

=== Runners and rules

What about runners and rules (r&r)?

* you might heavily rely on a few r&r's
* Jupiter has a brand new extension model
* it's totally different from JUnit 4's
* generally, r&r's don't (and won't) work in Jupiter
* a few runners are supported

=== Supported rules

Limited support:

* add this artifact:
+
```shell
org.junit.jupiter
junit-jupiter-migrationsupport
5.2.0
```
* add `@EnableRuleMigrationSupport` +
to Jupiter test class
* use selected rules as in JUnit 4

=== Supported rules

```java
@EnableRuleMigrationSupport
class JUnit4RuleInJupiter {

	@Rule
	public ExpectedException thrown =
		ExpectedException.none();

	@Test
	void useExpectedExceptionRule() {
		List<Object> list = List.of();
		thrown.expect(
			IndexOutOfBoundsException.class);
		list.get(0);
	}
}
```

=== Supported rules

Which rules are supported?

* `org.junit.rules.ExternalResource` +
(e.g. `TemporaryFolder`)
* `org.junit.rules.Verifier` +
(e.g. `ErrorCollector`)
* `org.junit.rules.ExpectedException`

=== What about others?

Jupiter has a powerful extension model:

* covers most existing use cases
* most r&r's can be reimplemented
* some already were

If you need a runner or rule as an extension, +
consider contributing to extensions projects!

=== Spring extension

To replace +
`SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`, `SpringRunner`, +
`SpringClassRule`, and `SpringMethodRule`:

* add this artifact:
+
```shell
org.springframework
spring-test
5.0.7.RELEASE
```
* use `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)`

=== Mockito extension

To replace `MockitoRule` and `MockitoJUnitRunner`:

* add this artifact:
+
```shell
org.mockito
mockito-junit-jupiter
2.20.1
```
* use `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`

=== Mockito extension

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MockitoTest {

	@InjectMocks private Circle circle;
	@Mock private Point center;

	@Test
	void shouldInjectMocks() {
		assertThat(center).isNotNull();
		assertThat(circle).isNotNull();
		assertThat(circle.center()).isSameAs(center);
	}
}
```

=== Moar extensions

If you need a runner or rule as an extension:

* for tool-specific extensions, +
contact that project
* for generic extensions +
or if projects don't want, +
contact https://junit-pioneer.org[JUnit Pioneer]

*Consider contributing!*

=== Where were we?

Migration:

* by default, only migrate tests +
when they need to be edited
* heavy reliance on r&r may +
complicate migration
* search for or develop +
appropriate extensions

=== What about new tests?

*By default, new tests should +
be written with Jupiter.*

But migration-caveats apply: +
Reliance on r&r may result in new JUnit 4 tests.

That's not a problem!

=== From 4 to 5
==== Summary

* JUnit 4 moves very slowly +
but is stable and reliable
* by default:
** migrate 3/4 tests only on demand
** write new tests against Jupiter
* use of runners and rules may +
hinder writing Jupiter tests
* support extension projects
