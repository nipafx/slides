== Dynamic tests

*Dynamic tests*

=== Defining tests

Up to now tests were identified

* by names +
(`test...` in JUnit 3 and before)
* by annotations +
(`@Test` in JUnit 4 and 5)

⇝ Tests had to be known at compile time.

=== Defining tests

*So what?!*

What if we want to create tests at run time?

=== Junit 5 to the rescue!

Dynamic tests allow creation of tests at run time.

* a test is wrapped into `DynamicTest`
* a bunch of them can be wrapped +
into `DynamicContainer`
* methods that create either of them +
are annotated with `@TestFactory`

=== Creating tests

```java
@TestFactory
List<DynamicTest> createPointTests() {
	return List.of(
		dynamicTest(
			"A Great Test For Point",
			() -> { /* test code */ } ),
		dynamicTest(
			"Another Great Test For Point",
			() -> { /* test code */ } )
	);
}
```

=== Creating containers

```java
	@TestFactory
	List<DynamicContainer> registeredTests() {
		return asList(
			dynamicContainer(
				"Dynamic Container #1",
				asList( /* dynamic tests */ )),
			dynamicContainer(
				"Dynamic Container #2",
				asList( /* dynamic tests */ ))
		);
	}
}
```

=== Implementation

The rest is straight-forward:

. JUnit detects `@TestFactory` methods
. calls them to generate containers and tests
. adds tests to the test tree
. eventually runs them

=== Running dynamic tests

Viewed by tools as separate tests:

=== Lifecycle

Not integrated into the lifecycle
(https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/378[#378]):

* `@Before/AfterAll` only called +
once per `@TestFactory`
* dynamic tests use shared state

=== Parameterized tests

```java
void pointTest(Point p) { /*...*/ }

@TestFactory
Stream<DynamicText> testingPoints() {
	return Stream.of(/* create points */)
		.map(p ->
			dynamicTest(
				"Testing " + p,
				() -> pointTest(p)));
}
```

=== Parameterized tests

```java
void pointTest(Point p) { /*...*/ }

@TestFactory
Stream<DynamicText> testingPoints() {
	List<Point> points = /* create points */;
	return DynamicTest.stream(
		points,
		p -> "Testing " + p,
		p -> pointTest(p));
}
```

=== File-based Tests

```java
void pointTest(Point p) { /*...*/ }

@TestFactory
Stream<DynamicText> testingPoints() {
	return Files
		.lines(pathToPointFile)
		.map(Point::parse)
		.map(p -> dynamicTest(
			"Testing " + p,
			() -> pointTest(p)));
}
```
////

=== Lambda tests

This would be great:

```java
class PointTest {

	"A great test for point" -> {
		/* test code */
	}

}
```

But how?

=== Lambda tests

```java
public class LambdaTest {

	private List<DynamicTest> tests;

	protected void λ(
			String name, Executable test) {
		tests.add(dynamicTest(name, test));
	}

	@TestFactory
	List<DynamicTest> tests() {
		return tests;
	}
}
```

=== Lambda tests

```java
class PointTest extends LambdaTest {{

	λ("A Great Test For Point", () -> {
		/* test code goes here */
	});

}}
```

* the inner braces create
 an https://reinhard.codes/2016/07/30/double-brace-initialisation-and-java-initialisation-blocks/[initialization block]
* code therein is run during construction
* JUnit will pick up the tests by calling `tests()`

=== Lambda tests

While we're hacking... what about this?

```java
class PointTest extends LambdaTest {{

	λ(a_great_test_for_point -> {
		/* test code goes here */
	});

}}
```

=== Dynamic tests
==== Summary

* to create tests at run time:
** write method that returns collection +
of `DynamicTest`/`DynamicContainer`
** annotate with `@TestFactory`
* not fully integrated in lifecycle
