=== Unreliable state

Ever had this problem?

* created or received an object
* called desired method on it
* watched it fail

⇝ Object can have state that makes methods fail.

⇝ Further configuration expected and required.

=== Unreliable state

Ever had this problem?

* refactored some code
* watched it work as expected
* watched tests/prod fail in +
  seemingly unrelated code with +
  seemingly unrelated error

⇝ Refactored code had a non-obvious +
  effect across the code base.

⇝ Distant parts of the code base are connected +
  by shared, state-changing objects.

=== Unreliable state

Ever had this problem?

* tried to implement a class' contract
* failed to do it in a simple manner +
  because of many corner cases?

⇝ Changing state typically increases +
space of possible states.

⇝ Large state space typically leads +
to many corner cases.

=== Unreliable state

Downsides:

* hard to reason about
* error-prone, fragile, and frustrating
* requires specialized knowledge to use correctly
* causes concurrency problems ("race conditions")
* hard to test & reuse

=== Exposed state

Common situation:

* class `State` encapsulates fields
* class `Action` needs their content +
  to perform an action

Common solution:

* `State` exposes all fields with getters
* `Action` "gets" needed content

=== Exposed state

Downsides:

* `State` has weak encapsulation
* `Action` is tightly coupled to `State`

This makes them hard to evolve.

=== Mixed concerns

Domain logic is often mixed +
with code that handles:

* looping
* lazy initialization
* concurrency
* ...

Such code has several responsibilities!

=== Mixed concerns

Downsides:

* easier to get wrong
* duplication
* longer and more complex code
* code has more reasons to change

=== Common problems

Caused by moving parts:

* unreliable state
* exposed state
* mixed concerns

=== Moving parts

[quote, 'https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/29581296216[Michael Feathers]']
____
OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.

=== Functional Programming

Essentials:

* compose _functions_, not _classes_
* prefer _immutable_ classes
* avoid _side effects_
* prefer _pure functions_

=== Functional programming

Tools:

* _composition_
* _contextual composition_
* _currying_
* _partial application_

=== Functional programming

Enjoy:

* _declarative_ instead of _imperative_
* _referential transparency_
* _laziness_
* _thread-safety_

=== Functional programming

Let's discuss basics:

* _functions_ vs _classes_
* _immutability_
* _side effects_
* _pure functions_

=== Functions over classes

[cols="h,2*",options="header"]
|===
|                | OOP            | FP

| passing        | messages       | results
| computation by | changing state | evaluation
|===

=== Functions in Java

Common terminology:

* a _method_ belongs to an object
* a _function_ stands alone

In that sense, Java has no functions.

With _function_ we typically mean +
instances of functional interfaces.

=== Immutability

> An object's (observable) state never changes

=== Immutability in Java

To implement an immutable class:

* make all fields `final`
* make defensive copies of mutable +
  constructor arguments
* never expose mutable field (e.g. `List`)
* never mutate a mutable field or argument
* make class `final` or constructor `private`

=== Immutability

Benefits:

* often easier to implement
* behave predictably
* easy to test
* can be safely shared between +
  objects and threads

=== Side effects

> An observable change of the outside world

=== Side effects in Java

To avoid side effects:

* no assignments to fields
* no mutating method calls +
  on fields and arguments

In Java, there is no good way +
to identify functions without side effects.

=== Side effects

Avoiding side effects makes code:

* more predictable
* easier to refactor and compose
* easier to test

=== Pure functions

> A side-effect free function whose return value is only defined by the arguments

=== Pure functions in Java

To have pure functions:

* no access of non-constant fields
* no mutating method calls on arguments

In Java, there is no good way +
to identify pure functions.

=== Pure functions

Benefits of pure functions:

* even more predictable (meaningful signature)
* even easier to refactor and compose
* even easier to test
* results in _referential transparency_

=== Functional programming

That were some basics:

* _functions_ vs _classes_
* _immutability_
* _side effects_
* _pure functions_

=== Functional programming

Now let's discuss tools:

* _composition_
* _contextual composition_
* _currying_
* _partial application_

=== Composition

> Combine (simple) functions to build more powerful ones

How-to:

* composed function has input of the first function
* passes result of a function as input to next function
* composed function has result of the last function

=== Composition in Java

```java
// hand-rolled
static <T, R, V> Function<T, V> compose(
		Function<T, R> first, Function<R, V> second) {
	return t -> {
		R firstResult = first.apply(t);
		V secondResult = second.apply(firstResult);
		return secondResult;
	}
}

// use
Function<String, Integer> length = String::length;
Function<Integer, String> toString = Integer::toString;
Function<String, String> lengthToString =
	compose(length, toString);
```

=== Composition in Java

```java
// on `Function<T, R>`
default <V> Function<T, V> andThen(Function<R, V> after) {
	return (T t) -> after.apply(this.apply(t));
}

// use
Function<String, Integer> length = String::length;
Function<Integer, String> toString = Integer::toString;
Function<String, String> lengthToString =
	length.andThen(toString);
```

=== Contextual composition

> Compose functions within a specific context while upholding its invariants

(*Note*: _contextual composition_ is not a common term.)

=== Context

What do I mean by _context_?

* "a value's presence is unknown" ⇝ `Optional`
* "a collection's multitude is arbitrary" ⇝ `Stream`

The context defines an API's central abstractions.

=== Invariants

What do I mean by _invariants_?

E.g. `Optional` manages presence/absence:

* no `NullPointerException`
* never passes `null`

An API safeguards its invariants +
while you focus on domain logic.

=== Composition

What do I mean by _composition_?

* functions can be "attached" to the context
* context determines whether/how they get composed

E.g. repeatedly calling `Optional.map(Function)`:

* effectively composes the passed functions
* `Optional` interjects its own logic

=== Contextual comp. in Java

> Compose functions within a specific context while upholding its invariants

For `Optional` that means:

> Use `map`, `flatMap`, etc. to compose operations on a present/absent value while being spared `null` and `NullPointerException`

=== Contextual comp. in Java

For example:

```java
// defines the context "presence/absence"
Optional<User> buyer = /*...*/;
// compose functions "User ~> Address" and
// "Address ~> String" without worrying
// about `null`
Optional<String> address = buyer
	.flatMap(this::findAddress)
	.map(Address::toString);
```

=== Contextual comp. in Java

So far, we know two such constructs:

* `Stream`
* `Optional`

We will get to know more +
_and_ build our own. 🤠

=== Contextual composition

Such contextual APIs often share basic functionality:

* `of` to "lift" plain values into the context
* `map` to apply a "value to value"-function
* `flatMap` to apply a "value to context"-function
* method to take value out of context +
  (`Optional::get`, `Stream::iterator`)

=== Monads

If `of`, `map`, `flatMap` fulfill certain requirements, +
the underlying type is a _monad_.

Monads:

* are a particularly well-behaving form +
  of contextual composition
* allow safe refactoring
* allow reuse of mental models

More on that later.

=== Currying

> Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument

=== Currying in Java

```java
public <T, U , R> Function<T, Function<U, R>> curry(
		BiFunction<T, U, R> f) {
//	return t -> (u -> f.apply(t, u));
	return t -> u -> f.apply(t, u);
}

BiFunction<User, Credentials, Login>
	login = (user, creds) -> logIn(user, creds);
Function<User, Function<Credentials, LoginResult>>
	cLogin = curry(login);
```

=== Currying

Benefits:

* makes you feel smart
* conceptual prerequisite for +
  partial application

=== Partial application

> Fixing some of a function's arguments, producing one with fewer arguments

=== Partial app. in Java

```java
public static <T, U, R> Function<U, R> partial(
		BiFunction<T, U, R> f, T t) {
	return u -> f.apply(t, u);
}

BiFunction<Level, String, Logger> newLogger =
	Logger::new;
Function<String, Logger> newLoggerWithLevel =
	partial(newLogger, Level.INFO);
```

=== Partial app. in Java

```java
public static <T, R> Supplier<R> partial(
		Function<T, R> f, T t) {
	return () -> f.apply(t);
}

Function<String, Logger> newLoggerWithLevel =
	partial(newLogger, Level.INFO);
Supplier<Logger> newLoggerWithLevelAndSubsystem =
	partial(newLoggerWithLevel, "Authentication");
```

=== Partial application

Benefits:

* elegant approach to configuration
* eliminates entire patterns +
  (factory, builder)

=== Functional programming

That were some tools:

* _composition_
* _contextual composition_
* _currying_
* _partial application_

=== Functional programming

Now let's discuss effects:

* _declarative_ instead of _imperative_
* _referential transparency_
* _laziness_
* _thread-safety_

=== Declarative

> Solve problems without specifying an exact procedure to be followed

(Often achieved by contextual composition.)

=== Declarative Java

Code expresses _what_ needs to happen...

```java
todos.stream()
	.filter(todo -> todo.importance().isAtLeast(VERY))
	.map(Todo::description)
	.collect(joining("\n"))
```

\... instead of _how_.

```java
String descs = "";
for (Todo todo : todos) {
	if (todo.importance().isAtLeast(VERY)) {
		String description = todo.description();
		descs += description + "\n";
	}
}
descs = descs.substring(0, descs.length() - 2);
```

=== Declarative

Declarative programming style:

* makes code more readable
* separates domain logic from +
  implementation details
* enables improvements across code base +
  (correctness, performance, ...)

=== Referential transparency

> An expression always evaluates to the same result in any context

(A consequence of using pure functions.)

=== Referential transparency

Benefits:

* easy to reason about, test, refactor, reuse, compose
* enables (automatic) optimizations:
** lazy evaluation
** parallelization
** memoization (i.e. caching)

=== Laziness

> The runtime can defer execution until the latest possible point in time

(A consequence of using pure functions.)

Benefits:

* avoids unnecessary computations

=== Parallelization

> The runtime can parallelize computations to optimize resource usage

(A consequence of using pure functions.)

Benefits:

* optimal resource utilization
* no self-rolled concurrency

=== Functional programming

That were some effects:

* _declarative_ instead of _imperative_
* _referential transparency_
* _laziness_
* _thread-safety_

=== Solutions to common problems

We discussed these common OOP problems:

* unreliable state
* exposed state
* mixed concerns

Let's see how FP can address them.

=== Unreliable state

Mechanisms:

* immutability
* no side effects
* pure functions

=== Unreliable state

Solutions:

* create object in working state
* instead of changing state:
** when "configuring", return new type
** when "updating", recreate
* pass input as parameters
* encode all effects in return value

=== Exposed state

Mechanisms:

* compose functions, not classes

Solution:

* keep state encapsulated
* pass actions as lambdas

=== Exposed state

Example:

```java
// in `State`:
public <T> T execute(Function<String, T> action) {
	return action.apply(stringState);
}

// in `Action`
Result result = state
	.execute(string -> action(string));
```

=== Exposed state

Next-level solution:

* let `State` configure action

```java
// in `State`:
public <T> Supplier<T> configure(
		Function<String, T> action) {
	return () -> action.apply(stringState);
}

// in `Action`
Supplier<Result> deferredAction = state
	.configure(string -> action(string));
// later...
Result result = deferredAction.get();
```

=== Mixed concerns

Mechanisms:

* compose functions, not classes
* look for contextual composition

Solution:

* separate concerns
* pass actions as lambdas

=== Mixed concerns

Example:

```java
private final Lazy<String> name =
	Lazy.of(() -> createName()));

// later
String n = name.get();
```

What's `Lazy`? +
That's the monad you're gonna build.

=== Why monads?

Why learn about monads?

* common term in FP
* hard to find a simple explanation
* useful structure to understand +
  (in FP and OOP!)

=== What is a monad?

[quote,Saunders Mac Lane, Categories for the Working Mathematician]
____
[A] monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with product × replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the identity endofunctor.
____

All clear? 😆

=== What is a monad?

More pragmatic:

* a structure for computational composition
* its methods follow certain rules

Thanks to abiding by those rules:

* refactoring is safe
* usage patterns transfer easily

=== Example monad
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

=== The kitchen
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

The kitchen:

* groceries are in the right place
* cutlery and dishes are clean
* appliances are ready to be used

The kitchen puts food into a "cooking context".

=== The kitchen
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

The kitchen has two features:

. bring food into the kitchen
. with a recipe for "_food_ to _other food_", it turns +
  a _kitchen + food_ into a _kitchen + other food_

```java
// methods on type `Kitchen<Food>`
static Kitchen<Food> bring(Food v)
Kitchen<Food> prepare(Function<Food, Food> f)
```

=== Three kitchen laws
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

"Don't play with food"::
If a recipe says "do nothing", _do nothing_.

```java
// given
Kitchen<Food> before = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Food> f = v -> v;
// when
Kitchen<Food> after = before.prepare(f);
// then
before === after;
```

=== Three kitchen laws
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

"The recipe is holy"::
It doesn't matter whether the food is prepared +
inside the kitchen or brought in afterwards.

```java
// given
Food v = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Food> f = /*...*/;
// when
Kitchen<Food> outside = Kitchen.bring(f.apply(v));
Kitchen<Food> inside = Kitchen.bring(v).prepare(f);
// then
inside === outside;
```

=== Three kitchen laws
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

"Artistic freedom"::
With two recipes, it doesn't matter whether we +
treat them as two separate or one long recipe.

```java
// given
Kitchen<Food> kitchen = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Food> f = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Food> g = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Food> fandg =
	v -> g.apply(f.apply(v));
// when
Kitchen<Food> twoSteps =
	kitchen.prepare(f).prepare(g);
Kitchen<Food> oneStep = kitchen.prepare(fandg);
// then
oneStep === twoSteps;
```

=== Kitchen extra feature
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

[start=3]
. with a recipe for "_food_ to _kitchen + other food_", it +
  turns a _kitchen + food_ into a _kitchen + other food_ +
  (the two nested kitchens get "flattened" into one)

In code:

```java
// compare to `prepare`:
// Kitchen<Food> prepare(Function<Food, Food> f)
Kitchen<Food> flatPrepare(Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> f)
```

The three laws can be formulated accordingly.

////
=== Three kitchen laws

"Don't play with food" (flatPrepare)::
If a recipe says "do nothing", _do nothing_.

```java
// given
Kitchen<Food> before = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> f =
	v -> bring(v);
// when
Kitchen<Food> after = before.flatPrepare(f);
// then
before === after;
```

=== Three kitchen laws

"The recipe is holy" (flatPrepare)::
It doesn't matter whether the food is prepared +
inside the kitchen or brought in while cooking.

```java
// given
Food v = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> f = /*...*/;
// when
Kitchen<Food> outside = f.apply(v);
Kitchen<Food> inside =
	Kitchen.bring(v).flatPrepare(f);
// then
inside === outside;
```

=== Three kitchen laws

"Artistic freedom" (flatPrepare)::
With two recipes, it doesn't matter whether we +
treat them as two separate or one long recipe.

```java
// given
Kitchen<Food> kitchen = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> f = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> g = /*...*/;
Function<Food, Kitchen<Food>> fandg =
	v -> f.apply(v).flatPrepare(g);
// when
Kitchen<Food> twoSteps =
	kitchen.flatPrepare(f).flatPrepare(g);
Kitchen<Food> oneStep = kitchen.flatPrepare(fandg);
// then
oneStep === twoSteps;
```
////

=== Kitchen law benefits
image::images/kitchen.jpg[background, size=cover]

```java
private Food cut(Food v) { /*...*/ }
private Food cook(Food v) { /*...*/ }
private Food admire(Food v) { return v; }

Kitchen.bring(ingredients)
	.prepare(this::cut)
	.prepare(this::cook);

Kitchen.bring(ingredients)
//          "artistic freedom"
	.prepare(v -> cook(cut(v)));

//           "the recipe is holy"
Kitchen.bring(cut(ingredients))
//          "don't play with food"
	.prepare(this::admire)
	.prepare(this::cook);
```

=== Monad parts

A monad consists of three parts:

* a type over values +
  (`Kitchen`; generally `M<V>`)
* a way to lift values into the type +
  (`bring`; generally `of`)
* a way to apply a function to the contained values +
  (`prepare`/`flatPrepare`, generally `map`/`flatMap`)

=== Monad laws

Right identity aka "don't play with food"::
+
```java
// for `M<V> m` and `f = v -> v`
m === m.map(f)
```

Left identity aka "the recipe is holy"::
+
```java
// for `V v` and `Function<V, V> f`
M.of(f.apply(v)) === M.of(v).map(f)
```

Associativity aka "artistic freedom"::
+
```java
// for `M<V> m` and `Function<V, V> f, g`
m.map(f).map(g) ===
	m.map(v -> g.apply(f.apply(v)))
```

////
=== Monad laws

Right identity aka "don't play with food"::
+
```java
// for `M<V> m` and `f = v -> M(v)`
m === m.flatMap(f)
```

Left identity aka "the recipe is holy"::
+
```java
// for `V v` and `Function<V, M<V>> f`
f.apply(v) === of(v).flatMap(f)
```

Associativity aka "artistic freedom"::
+
```java
// for `M<V> m` and `Function<V, M<V>> f, g`
m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g) ===
	m.flatMap(v -> f.apply(v).flatMap(g))
```
////

=== Your first (?) monad

Lazy initialization:

```java
private ComplexResource resource;

public ComplexResource getResource() {
	if (resource == null)
		resource = new ComplexResource();
	return resource;
}
```

Could this be a monad?

* what's the "computational context"?
* how to create one?
* how to interact with one?

=== The `Lazy` monad

Concept:

* computational context: "delayed resource initialization"
* create with recipe for initialization
* apply functions without executing them immediately
* accessing the resource...
+
====
** ...the first time, leads to initialization/application
** ...repeatedly, reuses existing result
====
+
(i.e. initializer and functions are executed at most once)


=== Exercises 1 - 3

Create a `Lazy` monad.

=== The `Lazy` monad

Public API (sans generic wildcards):

```java
public class Lazy<T> {

	public static <T> Lazy<T> of(Supplier<T> generator);
	public T get();
	public <U> Lazy<U> map(Function<T, U> function);
	public <U> Lazy<U> flatMap(Function<T, Lazy<U>> function);

}
```

=== The `Lazy` monad

Creation:

```java
private final Supplier<T> generator;
private T element;

private Lazy(Supplier<T> generator) {
	this.generator = requireNonNull(generator);
	this.element = null;
}

public static <T> Lazy<T> of(Supplier<T> generator) {
	return new Lazy<>(generator);
}
```

=== The `Lazy` monad

Mapping:

```java
public static <T> Lazy<T> of(Supplier<T> generator) {
	return new Lazy<>(generator);
}

public <U> Lazy<U> map(Function<T, U> function) {
	return Lazy.of(() -> function.apply(this.get()));
}

public <U> Lazy<U> flatMap(Function<T, Lazy<U>> function) {
	return Lazy.of(() -> function.apply(this.get()).get());
}
```

=== The `Lazy` monad

At-most-once initialization:

```java
private final Supplier<T> generator;
private T element;

public T get() {
	// TODO: guarantee "at most once"
	//       under multi-threading
	if (element == null)
		element = generator.get();
	return element;
}
```

=== The `Lazy` monad

Application:

```java
private final Lazy<Orders> orders;

// in constructor
orders = Lazy
	.of(() -> loadUserWithId(userId))
	.map(this::loadOrdersForUser);
```

* reuses code and understanding of monads
* reduces (observable) mutability

=== Monads

That adds a third monad:

* `Stream`
* `Optional`
* `Lazy`

=== `Optional` is no monad!

😰

=== Exercise 4

"Breaking the (monad) law"

=== Right identity

Right identity aka "don't play with food"::
+
```java
opt === opt.map(v -> v)
```

✔

=== Left identity

Left identity aka "the recipe is holy"::
+
```java
// for `V v` and `Function<V, V> f`
M.of(f.apply(v)) === M.of(v).map(f)
```

```java
String v = null;
Function f = s -> "mango";
// Optional["mango"]
Optional applied = ofNullable(f.apply(v));
// Optional[]
Optional mapped = ofNullable(v).map(f);
```

=== Associativity

Associativity aka "artistic freedom"::
+
```java
// for `M<V> m` and `Function<V, V> f, g`
m.map(f).map(g) ===
	m.map(v -> g.apply(f.apply(v)))
```

```java
String v = "kiwi";
Function f = s -> null;
Function g = s -> "mango";
// Optional[]
Optional mapped = of(v).map(f).map(g);
// Optional["mango"]
Optional composed = of(v).map(f.andThen(g));
```

=== Root cause analysis

* `Optional` maps `null` to `empty()`
* `flatMap` and `map` are not executed +
on empty optionals
* the first occurrence of `null`/empty +
stops the chain of executions

=== So What?

* refactoring can change +
which code gets executed
* functions that can "recover" from `null` +
might not get executed
* particularly error-prone when +
functions have side effects

=== Consequences

Be aware:

* `Optional` is no well-behaved monad +
  if `null` is involved
* refactoring can cause problems +
  if `null` was special cased

See `Optional` as a way to avoid handling `null` +
(at the expense of breaking monad laws).

=== Summary

FP can ease some common problems of OOP:

* make state more reliable with immutability
* encapsulate state and separate concerns +
  by creating monads and passing actions
* improve concurrency with immutability +
  and pure functions

These benefits are gradual.

Writing subsystems in a functional style +
with OOP-style boundary makes sense!
