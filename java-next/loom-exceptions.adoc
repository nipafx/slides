=== Exceptions

Pinning: ::
* a _pinned_ VT will block the PT
* caused by object monitors, +
  native calls, class initialization

Capture: ::
* a _captured_ VT blocks the PT
* caused by file I/O

=== Object monitor pinning

Object monitor implementation:

* was bound to OS threads
* required deep refactoring +
  to work with VTs
* fix ships with JDK 24

⇝ No more pinning for `synchronized`.

=== Native code pinning

Cause:

* native code works on PT's stack
* switching PTs would wreak havoc

Fix:

* possible in the JVM, but expensive
* fairly easy to avoid

⇝ Don't call native code, then back to Java, then block.

=== File I/O capture

File I/O capture is caused by JVM/OS limitations.

Linux `io_uring` allows async I/O but:

* adoption incurrs overhead
* considerable compared to cached SSD-reads
* cost/benefit is not good

⇝ No fix for now.
