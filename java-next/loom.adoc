=== Virtual threads

A _virtual_ thread:

* is a regular `Thread`
* low memory footprint (stack + bytes)
* small switching cost
* scheduled by the Java runtime
* executes on platform thread
* waits in memory +
  (no platform thread blocked)

=== Virtual threads

Resolve the conflict between:

Simplicity::
* simple-to-use, blocking programming
* aligns with platform (tooling, debugging, …)
Throughput::
* minimizes overhead while waiting
* removes number-of-threads as bottleneck

=== Performance

Virtual threads aren't "faster threads": +
Each task takes the same time (same _latency_).

Virtual threads increase _throughput_:

* when workload is not CPU-bound _and_
* when number of concurrent tasks is high

=== Use Cases

Virtual threads are cheap and plentiful:

* no pooling necessary
* allows thread per task
* allows liberal creation +
  of threads for subtasks

⇝ Enables new concurrency programming models.

=== Project Loom

Virtual threads:

* code is simple to write, debug, profile
* allows high throughput

Structured concurrency:

* clearer concurrency code
* simpler failure/success policies
* better debugging

Scoped values:

* safer, more scalable data sharing

=== Timeline

JDK 21:

* virtual threads finalize (https://openjdk.org/jeps/444[JEP 444])
* structured concurrency previews (https://openjdk.org/jeps/453[JEP 453])
* scoped values preview (https://openjdk.org/jeps/446[JEP 446])

JDK 25:

* object monitors don't pin virtual threads (https://openjdk.org/jeps/491[JEP 491])
* structured concurrency preview revamp (https://openjdk.org/jeps/499[JEP 499])
* scoped values finalize (https://openjdk.org/jeps/506[JEP 506])

=== Timeline

Current work:

* finalize structured concurrency
* reduce pinning during class initialization
* improve lock info in thread dumps
