> JVM features and APIs for supporting easy-to-use, high-throughput, lightweight concurrency and new programming models

Profile:

* https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/[project] /
https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/loom/Main[wiki] /
http://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/loom-dev[mailing list]
* launched January 2018
* led by Ron Pressler

=== Motivation

An application with many blocking operations +
had two options:

* block platform (OS) threads until task completion:
** simple-to-use programming paradigm
** can limit throughput
* use asnychronous programming
** harder to write and harder still to debug
** allows higher throughput

=== Motivation

Resolve the conflict between:

* simplicity
* throughput

=== Enter virtual threads!

A _virtual_ thread:

* is a regular `Thread`
* low memory footprint (stack + bytes)
* small switching cost
* scheduled by the Java runtime
* executes on platform thread
* waits in memory +
  (no platform thread blocked)

=== Performance

Virtual threads aren't "faster threads": +
Each task takes the same time (same _latency_).

Virtual threads increase _throughput_:

* when workload is not CPU-bound _and_
* when number of concurrent tasks is high

=== Use Cases

Virtual threads are cheap and plentiful:

* no pooling necessary
* allows thread per task
* allows liberal creation +
  of threads for subtasks

‚áù Enables new concurrency programming models.

=== Project Loom

Virtual threads:

* code is simple to write, debug, profile
* allows high throughput

Structured concurrency:

* clearer concurrency code
* simpler failure/success policies
* better debugging

Scoped values:

* safer, more scalable data sharing

=== Timeline

JDK 21:

* virtual threads finalize (https://openjdk.org/jeps/444[JEP 444])
* structured concurrency previews (https://openjdk.org/jeps/453[JEP 453])
* scoped values preview (https://openjdk.org/jeps/446[JEP 446])

JDK 24:

* object monitors no longer pin virtual threads (https://openjdk.org/jeps/491[JEP 491])
* structured concurrency in 4th preview (https://openjdk.org/jeps/499[JEP 499])
* scoped values in 4th preview (https://openjdk.org/jeps/446[JEP 487])

=== Timeline

Current work:

* finalize structured concurrency and +
  scoped values APIs
* reduce pinning during class initialization
* improve lock info in thread dumps

JDK 25:

* structured concurrency in 5th preview (https://openjdk.org/jeps/499[JEP 499])
* scoped values ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
