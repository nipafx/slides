> Faster startup, shorter time to peak performance, smaller footprint

Profile:

* https://openjdk.org/projects/leyden/[project] /
https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/leyden-dev[mailing list] /
https://jdk.java.net/leyden[early access builds]
* launched May 2022
* led by Mark Reinhold

=== Motivation

Java has really good peak performance, +
but also tends to have:

* slow startup time
* slow warmup time

=== Startup & Warmup

Early work by the runtime:

* class loading
* callsite linkage
* constant pool resolution
* interpretation
* profile gathering
* JIT compilation (C1, C2)

Can we shift this work?

=== Shifting Computation

Java already shifts computation:

* compile-time constant folding
* class loading
* garbage collection
* out-of-order execution
* ...

Let's shift more computation ahead of time!

=== Dynamic Java

But Java is highly dynamic:

* class loading
* class redefinition
* linkage
* access control
* method dispatch
* run-time typing (e.g. casting)
* introspection
* JIT compilation, decompilation

How to AOT everything?

=== Enter AOTCache

Leyden introduces _AOTCache_:

* observe JVM
* capture decisions in AOTCache +
  (expansion of _CDS Archive_)
* use as "initial state" during future run
* fall back to live observation/optimization +
  if necessary and possible

=== AOT workflow

```sh
# training run (⇝ profile)
$ java -XX:AOTMode=record
       -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
# assembly phase (profile ⇝ AOTCache)
$ java -XX:AOTMode=create
       -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf
       -XX:AOTCache=app.aot
       -cp app.jar
# production run (AOTCache ⇝ performance)
$ java -XX:AOTCache=app.aot
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
```

=== AOT workflow

Shortcut for most cases:

```sh
# training run (⇝ AOTCache)
$ java -XX:AOTCacheOutput=app.aot
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
# production run (AOTCache ⇝ performance)
$ java -XX:AOTCache=app.aot
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
```

(Open to further improvements.)

=== AOT class loading & linking

> Improve startup time by making the classes of an application instantly available, in a loaded and linked state, when the HotSpot JVM starts.

Spring PetClinic benchmarks:

* up to ~40% startup time reduction
* AOT cache size of ~130 MB

=== AOT method profiling

> Improve warmup time by making method-execution profiles from a previous run of an application instantly available, when the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine starts.

Benchmark of a 100_000x loop over a simple stream:

* ~20% run time reduction
* AOT cache size increased by ~2.5%

=== AOT limitations

Limitation so far:

* same JDK release / architecture / OS
* consistent class path for training and production
* consistent module options
* limited use of JVMTI agents

Otherwise, AOT cache is ignored.

=== AOT everything

Leyden's early access builds AOT more:

* constant resolution
* code compilation
* dynamic proxies
* reflection data
* unfound classes

Benchmarks show ~70% startup time reduction.

=== Project Leyden

* improves Java's overall footprint
* focusses on startup/warmup time +
  by caching early JVM work
* may explore stricter constraints +
  for more aggressive optimization

=== Timeline

JDK 25:

* AOT class loading & linking (https://openjdk.org/jeps/483[JEP 483])
* AOT method profiling (https://openjdk.org/jeps/515[JEP 515])

JDK 26:

* AOT with any GC (https://openjdk.org/jeps/516[JEP 516])

Current work:

* AOT code compilation (https://openjdk.org/jeps/8335368[JEP draft])
* inclusion of more dynamic information
