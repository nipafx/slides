Profile:

* https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/[project] /
https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/amber/Main[wiki] /
https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/amber-dev[mailing list]
* launched March 2017
* led by Brian Goetz

=== Motivation

Some downsides of Java:

* can be cumbersome
* tends to require boilerplate
* situational lack of expressiveness

Amber continuously improves that situation.

=== Delivered

* multi-file source launcher „âí (https://openjdk.org/jeps/458[JEP 458])
* unnamed variables and patterns „âí (https://openjdk.org/jeps/456[JEP 456])
* patterns in switch „âë (https://openjdk.org/jeps/441[JEP 441])
* record patterns „âë (https://openjdk.org/jeps/440[JEP 440])
* sealed types ‚ë∞ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/409[JEP 409])
* records ‚ëØ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/395[JEP 395])
* type pattern matching ‚ëØ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/394[JEP 394])
* text blocks ‚ëÆ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/378[JEP 378])
* switch expressions ‚ë≠ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/361[JEP 361])
* local-variable type inference with `var` ‚ë© (https://openjdk.org/jeps/286[JEP 286])

=== Pattern Matching

Amber's main thrust is pattern matching:

* records
* sealed types
* improved switch
* patterns

=== Amber endeavors

Other endeavors and conversations:

* primitive types in patterns (https://openjdk.org/jeps/488[JEP 488])
* simplified main (https://openjdk.org/jeps/495[JEP 495])
* flexible constructor bodies (https://openjdk.org/jeps/492[JEP 492])
* deconstruction of classes
* derived record creation ("withers") (https://openjdk.org/jeps/468[JEP 468])
* deconstruction assignment (https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1599000138793771010[announcement])
* serialization 2.0 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbqAyRJoQO0[talk at Devoxx BE])
* concise method bodies (https://openjdk.org/jeps/8209434[JEP draft])

=== String Templates?

=== Project Amber

* makes Java more expressive
* reduces amount of code
* makes us more productive

=== Timeline

JDK 21:

* records & sealed types
* pattern matching basics
* text blocks
* single-file source launcher

JDK 22:

* unnamed patterns
* multi-file source launcher

=== Timeline

Current work:

* simplified main (https://openjdk.org/jeps/495[JEP 495])
* flexible constructor bodies (https://openjdk.org/jeps/492[JEP 492])
* primitive types in patterns (https://openjdk.org/jeps/488[JEP 488])
* deconstruction
