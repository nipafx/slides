* launched July 2014
* led by Brian Goetz

=== Motivation

Java has a split type system:

* primitives
* classes

We can only create classes, but:

* have identity
* have references

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* split caused by need for numerical performance
* got worse with generics
* got weird with (auto-)boxing
* got worse again with lambdas/streams
--

=== Identity

All classes come with _identity_:

* extra memory for header
* mutability
* locking, synchronization, etc.

But not all custom types need that!

=== References

All class instances come as _references_:

* memory access indirection
* nullability

But not all custom types need that!

=== Project Valhalla

Valhalla's goal is to unify the type system:

* _value types_ (disavow identity)
* _null-restriction_ + _implicit constructors_ +
  (disavow references)
* _universal generics_ (`ArrayList<int>`)
* _specialized generics_ (backed by `int[]`)

=== Value types

[source,java]
----
value class ComplexNumber {

	private double real;
	private double imaginary;

	// constructor, etc.
}
----

Codes (almost) like a class - exceptions:

* class and fields are implicitly final
* superclasses are limited

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* can be records
* fields, methods, constructors
* use generics, implement interfaces
* nested classes, class literals
--

=== Value type behavior

No identity:

* some runtime operations throw exceptions
* "identity" check `==` compares by state
* `null` is default value

Benefits:

* guaranteed immutability
* more expressiveness
* more optimizations

=== Migration to value types

> The JDK (as well as other libraries) has many value-based classes, such as `Optional` and `LocalDateTime`. [...]
> We plan to migrate many value-based classes in the JDK to value classes.

=== Getting rid of references

In general, value types have references:

* allow `null`
* prevent flattening

How do we get rid of them?

=== Null-restriction

Details are in flux, but possibly:

* null-restructed variables and fields:
+
```java
// number can't be null
ComplexNumber! number = // ...
```
* implicit constructor marks good _default instance_

=== Implicit constructors

```java
value class ComplexNumber {

	private double real;
	private double imaginary;

	// implicitly sets all fields to default values
	public implicit ComplexNumber();

	public ComplexNumber(double r, double i) {
		// ...
	}

	// etc.

}
```

=== No references

The just-in-time compiler _can_ +
inline/flatten variables ‚Ä¶

* of a value type
* with implicit constructor
* that are null-restricted

Performance comparable to today's primitives! üöÄ

=== Emergent performance

Don't create a type _in order to_ get performance.

Instead:

* "Is the type value-ish?" ‚áù value type
* "Is all-fields-default usable?" ‚áù implicit constructor
* "Is no `null` needed?" ‚áù restrict nullness

Performance emerges from domain decisions!

=== Universal generics

When everybody creates their own value classes, +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

Universal generics allow value classes +
as type parameters:

[source,java]
----
List<long> ids = new ArrayList<>();
List<RationalNumber> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
----

=== Specialized generics

Healing the rift in the type system is great!

But if `ArrayList<int>` is backed by `Object[]`, +
it will still be avoided in many cases.

Specialized generics will fix that: +
Generics over primitives will avoid references!

=== Project Valhalla

Value types, implicit constructors, null-restriction +
plus universal and specialized generics:

* fewer trade-offs between +
  design and performance
* no more manual specializations
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs

Makes Java more expressive and performant.
