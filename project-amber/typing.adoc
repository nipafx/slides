== Type Safety & Encapsulation

How Project Amber tackles the tension +
*explicitness/safety vs succinctness* +
for less verbosity and new features.

=== Type Safety

Java is...

strongly typed: ::
every field, variable, method argument +
and return has a type

statically typed: ::
all this is known at compile time

=== Encapsulation

For our types, fields, methods:

* decouple API from internal state
* hide internals (behind accessors)
* pick lowest feasible visibility

=== Type Safety & Encapsulation

We rely on them to:

* model domains
* guarantee invariants
* modularize problems
* catch errors early
* understand code

=== Type Safety & Encapsulation

But, they can be:

* verbose
* redundant

Underlying tension: +
explicitness/safety vs succinctness.

=== Throwback: Lambdas

```java
Predicate<Person> isOld = person -> person.age() >= 30;
```

* didn't allow anything new!
* focus on what's essential +
  (behavior and semantics)
* removed lots of verbosity +
  (and bits of explicitness)

Found a (situationally) better balance. +
⇝ More "code as data".

=== Project Amber

Aims to do more of that:

* give up small amounts of benefits
* in suitable, specific situations
* for new semantics and features
* for much more succinctness

=== Local-Variable Type Inference

Java 10 introduced `var` (https://openjdk.org/jeps/286[JEP 286]):

```java
var audienceMember = new Person("John Doe");
```

* focus on what's essential +
  (variable name and expression)
* removes verbosity & redundancy +
  (and bits of explicitness)

Finds a better balance (if used wisely). +
⇝ More readable variables.

=== Records

Java 16 introduced records (https://openjdk.org/jeps/395[JEP 395]):

```java
record Person(String name, LocalDate birthday) { }
```

> Transparent carriers for immutable data.

* compiler understands internals
* couple API to internals
* reduce verbosity _a lot_

Defines a new point of balance. +
⇝ More "data as data".

=== Pattern Matching

In `if` since Java 16 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/394[JEP 394]), +
in `switch` since Java 21 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/441[JEP 441]):

```java
if (obj instanceof Person person) {
	var name = person.name();
	var bday = person.birtday();
	// use `name` and `bday`
}

switch (obj) {
	case Person person -> {
		// as above...
	}
	// ...
}
```

=== Destructuring Records

Java 21 introduced record patterns (https://openjdk.org/jeps/440[JEP 440]):

```java
if (obj instanceof Person(var name, var bday)) {
	// use `name` and `bday`
}

switch (obj) {
	case Person(var name, var bday) -> {
		// use `name` and `bday`
	}
	// ...
}
```

=== Destructuring Records

```java
var person = fetchPerson();
var name = person.name();
var bday = person.birtday();
// use `name` and `bday`
```

In the future (no JEP, but https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1599000138793771010[it's coming]):

```java
// speculative syntax
Person(var name, var bday) = fetchPerson();
// use `name` and `bday`
```

=== Destructuring Records

```java
var person = fetchPerson();
var unnamed = new Person("", person.birthday());
```

Maybe _functional mutation_ in the future +
(https://github.com/openjdk/amber-docs/blob/master/eg-drafts/reconstruction-records-and-classes.md[design document] from Aug 2020):

```java
// highly speculative syntax
var person = fetchPerson();
var unnamed = person with {
	name = "";
};
```

=== Summary

Type safety and encapsulation:

* are bedrocks of Java
* but aren't free

Project Amber introduces new features that:

* lower the cost
* make them shine brighter
