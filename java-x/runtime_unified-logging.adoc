Observing the JVM at work.

=== Unified Logging

New logging infrastructure for the JVM +
(e.g. OS interaction, threading, GC, etc.):

* JVM log messages pass through new mechanism +
* works similar to known logging frameworks:
** textual messages
** log level
** time stamps
** meta information (like subsystem)
* output can be configured with `-Xlog`

=== Unified Logging

=== First Try

Plain use of `-Xlog`:

```sh
$ java -Xlog -version

# truncated a few messages
> [0.002s][info][os       ] HotSpot is running ...
# truncated a lot of messages
```

You can see:

* JVM uptime (2ms)
* log level (`info`)
* tags (`os`)
* message

=== Configuring `-Xlog`

This can be configured:

* which messages to show
* where messages go
* what messages should say

How? `-Xlog:help` lists all options.

=== Which Messages?

Configure with _selectors_: `$TAG_SET=$LEVEL`:

```sh
# "exactly gc" on "warning"
-Xlog:gc=warning
# "including gc" on "warning"
-Xlog:gc*=warning
# "exactly gc and os" on "debug"
-Xlog:gc+os=debug
# "gc" on "debug" and "os" on warning
-Xlog:gc=debug,os=warning
```

Defaults:

```sh
-Xlog       # the same as -Xlog:all
-Xlog:$TAG  # same as -Xlog:$TAG=info
```

=== Where Do Messages Go?

Three possible locations:

* `stdout` (default)
* `stderr`
* `file=$FILENAME` +
  (file rotation is possible)

Example:

```sh
# all debug messages into application.log
-Xlog:all=debug:file=application.log
```

=== Which Information?

_Decorators_ define what is shown:

* `time`: time and date (also in ms and ns)
* `uptime`: time since JVM start (also in ms and ns)
* `pid`: process identifier
* `tid`: thread identifier
* `level`: log level
* `tags`: tag-set

Example:

```sh
# show uptime in ms and level
-Xlog:all:stdout:level,uptimemillis
```

=== Put Together

Formal syntax:

```sh
-Xlog:$SELECTORS:$OUTPUT:$DECORATORS:$OUTPUT_OPTS
```

* `$SELECTORS` are pairs of tag sets and log levels +
  (the docs call this _what-expression_)
* `$OUTPUT` is `stdout`, `stderr`, or `file=<filename>`
* `$DECORATORS` define what is shown
* `$OUTPUT_OPTS` configure file rotation

Elements have to be defined from left to right. +
(But can be empty, e.g. `-Xlog::stderr`.)
