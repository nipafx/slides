// The JDK as common ground for reactive stream libraries.

=== Reactive Types

`Publisher`::
* produces items to consume
* can be subscribed to
`Subscriber`::
* subscribes to publisher
* `onNext`, `onError`, `onComplete`
`Subscription`::
* connection from subscriber to publisher
* `request`, `cancel`

=== Reactive Flow
==== Subscribing

* create `Publisher pub` and `Subscriber sub`
* call `pub.subscribe(sub)`
* pub creates `Subscription script` +
and calls `sub.onSubscription(script)`
* `sub` can store `script`

=== Reactive Flow
==== Streaming

* `sub` calls `script.request(10)`
* `pub` calls `sub.onNext(element)` (max 10x)

==== Canceling

* `pub` may call `sub.OnError(err)` +
or `sub.onComplete()`
* `sub` may call `script.cancel()`

=== Reactive APIs?

JDK only provides three interfaces +
and one simple implementation.

(Also called *Flow API*.)

So far, only reactive HTTP/2 API â‘ª uses Flow.
