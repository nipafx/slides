// Simple classes ~> simple code

=== Spilling Beans

Typical Java Bean:

```java
public class Range {

	// part I üòÄ

	private final int low;
	private final int high;

	public Range(int low, int high) {
		this.low = low;
		this.high = high;
	}

}
```

=== Spilling Beans

```java
public class Range {

	// part II üôÑ

	public int getLow() {
		return low;
	}

	public int getHigh() {
		return high;
	}

}
```

=== Spilling Beans

```java
public class Range {

	// part III ü§®

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object o) {
		if (this == o)
			return true;
		if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass())
			return false;
		Range range = (Range) o;
		return low == range.low &&
				high == range.high;
	}

}
```

=== Spilling Beans

```java
public class Range {

	// part IV ü•¥

	@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		return Objects.hash(low, high);
	}

}
```

=== Spilling Beans

```java
public class Range {

	// part V üò≠

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "[" + low + "; " + high + "]";
	}

}
```

=== "Java is Verbose"

`Range.java` is simple:

* declares type `Range`
* declares two components, `low` and `high`

Takes 44 lines!

* verbose
* room for error
* unexpressive

=== Records

```java
//                these are "components"
public record Range(int low, int high) {

	// compiler generates:
	//  * (final) fields
	//  * canonical constructor
	//  * accessors low(), high()
	//  * equals, hashCode, toString

}
```

=== Records

> The API for a record models the state, the whole state, and nothing but the state.

The deal:

* give up encapsulation
* couple API to internal state
* get API for free

=== Records

The benefits:

* no boilerplate for plain "data carriers"
* no room for error
* makes Java more expressive

On to the details!

=== Limited Records

Records are limited classes:

* no inheritance
** can't use `extends`
** are `final`
* component fields are `final`
* no additional fields

=== Customizable Records

Records can be customized:

* override constructor
* add constructors and +
  static factory methods
* override accessors
* add other methods
* override `Object` methods
* implement interfaces
* make serializable

=== Override Constructors

```java
public Range(int low, int high) {
	if (high < low)
		throw new IllegalArgumentException();
	this.low = low;
	this.high = high;
}
```

=== Override Constructors

Compact canonical constructor:

```java
// executed before fields are assigned
public Range {
	if (high < low)
		throw new IllegalArgumentException();
}

// arguments can be reassigned
public Range {
	if (high < low)
		high = low;
}
```

=== Override Constructors

* implicit constructor has same visibility as record
* explicit constructors can't reduce visibility
* can't assign fields in compact form +
(happens automatically after its execution)

=== Add Constructors

Additional constructors work as usual:

```java
public Range(int high) {
	this(0, high);
}
```

(Compact canonical constructor can't delegate.)

=== Add Static Factories

Additional static factories work as usual:

```java
public static Range open(int low, int high) {
	return new Range(low, high + 1);
}
```

Can't reduce constructor visibility, though.

```java
@Deprecated
// use static factory method instead
public Range { }
```

=== Override Accessors

Accessors can be overridden:

```java
@Override
public low() {
	return Math.max(0, low);
}
```

Not a good example!

> The API for a record models the state, the whole state, and nothing but the state.

=== Implement Interfaces

```java
public record Range(int low, int high)
		implements Comparable<Range> {

	@Override
	public int compareTo(Range other) {
		return this.low == other.low
			? this.high - other.high
			: this.low - other.low;
	}

}
```

=== Serializable Records

```java
public record Range(int low, int high)
		implements Serializable { }
```

* has default `serialVersionUID` 0
* uses `FileOutputStream` and +
  `FileInputStream` as usual
* deserializaton calls constructor üôå
* framework support is growing +
  (e.g. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson], https://johnzon.apache.org/[Apache Johnzon])

////
TODO
* method-local classes
* inner records are effectively static
* inner classes can now contain static member
////

=== Summary

* use records to replace data carriers
* it's not anti-boilerplate pixie dust +
  ‚áù use only when "the deal" makes sense
* beware of limitations
* beware of class-building facilites
* observe ecosystem for adoption
