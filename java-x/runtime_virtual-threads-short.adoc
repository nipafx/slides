=== A simple web request

Imagine a hypothetical HTTP request:

. interpret request
. query database (_blocks_)
. process data for response

Resource utilization:

* good for 1. and 3.
* really bad for 2.

How to implement that request?

=== Synchronous

Align application's unit of concurrency (request)  +
with Java's unit of concurrency (thread):

* use thread per request
* simple to write, debug, profile
* blocks threads on certain calls
* limited number of _platform_ threads +
  ‚áù bad resource utilization +
  ‚áù low throughput

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* common CPU load: 5-30%
--

=== Asynchronous

Only use threads for actual computations:

* use non-blocking APIs (futures / reactive streams)
* harder to write, challenging to debug/profile
* incompatible with synchronous code
* shares platform threads +
  ‚áù great resource utilization +
  ‚áù high throughput

=== Conflict!

There's a conflict between:

* simplicity
* throughput

=== Enter virtual threads!

A _virtual_ thread:

* is a regular `Thread`
* low memory footprint ([k]bytes)
* small switching cost
* scheduled by the Java runtime
* requires no OS thread when waiting

Think of them like you +
think about virtual memory.

=== Example

```java
try (var executor = Executors
		.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
	for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
		var number = i;
		executor.submit(() -> {
			Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
			return number;
		});
	}
} // executor.close() is called implicitly, and waits
```

=== Example

This laptop:

* Intel i7-1165G7 (11th Gen)
* 8GB for JVM (32 GB total RAM)
* Gentoo Linux (kernel v6.5.10)

Extremely rough measurements:

|===
| #threads |   1k |  10k | 100k | 500k | 1m |  5m
| run time | 1.0s | 1.1s | 1.3s |   3s | 6s | 20s
|===

=== Effects

Virtual threads:

* aren't "faster threads"
* remove "number of threads" as bottleneck
* match app's unit of concurrency to Java's

Virtual threads increase _throughput_:

* when workload is not CPU-bound
* when number of concurrent tasks is high

‚áù _simplicity && throughput_

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* maximize progress other systems can make.
* "high": more than a few thousand
--

=== Server how-to

For servers:

* request handling threads are started by web framework
* frameworks will offer (easy) configuration options

We're getting there.

=== Spring Boot

Set property on 3.2 (Nov 2023):

```
spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
```

=== Quarkus

Annotate request handling method on 3.?:

```java
@GET
@Path("api")
@RunOnVirtualThread
public String handle() {
	// ...
}
```

=== Helidon

Just works on 4.0 (currently RC1).
