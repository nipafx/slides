=== Virtual Threads

A _virtual_ thread:

* is a regular `Thread`
* low memory footprint (stack + bytes)
* small switching cost
* scheduled by the Java runtime
* executes on platform thread
* waits in memory +
  (no platform thread blocked)

=== Exceptions

Pinning: ::
* a _pinned_ VT will block the PT
* caused by **object monitors**, +
  native calls, class initialization

Capture: ::
* a _captured_ VT blocks the PT
* caused by file I/O

=== Object monitor pinning

Object monitor implementation:

* was bound to OS threads
* required deep refactoring +
  to work with VTs
* fix ships with JDK 24

‚áù No more pinning for `synchronized`.
