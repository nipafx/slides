=== Cleaning house

Already removed:

* 32-bit x86 ports „âï (https://openjdk.org/jeps/503[JEP 503])
* security manager „âî (https://openjdk.org/jeps/486[JEP 486])
* biased locking ‚ë± (https://openjdk.org/jeps/374[JEP 374], https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8256425[JDK-8256425])
* RMI activation ‚ë∞ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/407[JEP 407])
* Nashorn ‚ëÆ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/372[JEP 372])
* concurrent mark sweep GC ‚ë≠ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/363[JEP 363])

=== Security Manager

What it was:

* a system of checks and permissions
* intended to safeguard security-relevant +
  code sections
* embodied by `SecurityManager`

=== Security Manager

What you need to know:

* barely used but maintenance-intensive
* disallowed by default since JDK 18
* removed in JDK 24
** command-line flags cause errors
** `SecurityManager` still exists
** all calls are no-ops

=== Security Manager

What you need to do:

* observe your app with security manager disabled +
  (`java.security.manager=disallow` on JDK 12+)
* if used, move away from security manager

=== Cleaning house

Deprecated (for removal)

* memory access via `Unsafe` „âî (https://openjdk.org/jeps/498[JEP 498])
* finalization ‚ë± (https://openjdk.org/jeps/421[JEP 421])
* applet API ‚ë∞ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/398[JEP 398], https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345525[JDK-8345525] üëÄ)
// * primitive wrapper constructors ‚ëØ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/390[JEP 390])

Disallow by default:

* JNI „âî (https://openjdk.org/jeps/472[JEP 472])
* dynamic agents „âë (https://openjdk.org/jeps/451[JEP 451])

=== Unsafe

Methods for memory access have been superseeded +
(VarHandles via https://openjdk.org/jeps/193[JEP 193]; FFM via https://openjdk.org/jeps/454[JEP 454]).

Will be phased out:

* deprecation and compile-time warning „âì
* run-time warning „âî
* exception on invocation ~„âñ
* remove methods

=== Unsafe

You're probably not using it directly, +
but your dependencies may.

Find them with `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access`:

* `warn`: to get run-time warnings
* `debug`: same with more info
* `deny`: throws exception

Report and help fix!

=== Finalization

What it is:

* `finalize()` methods
* a JLS/GC machinery for them

=== Finalization

What you need to know:

* you can disable with `--finalization=disabled`
* in a future release, `disabled` will be the default
* in a later release, finalization will be removed

=== Finalization

What you need to do:

* search for `finalize()` in your code and +
  replace with `try`-with-resources or `Cleaner` API
* search for `finalize()` in your dependencies and +
  help remove them
* run your app with `--finalization=disabled` and +
  closely monitor resource behavior (e.g. file handles)

=== JNI

Native code can undermine Java's integrity.

App owner should opt in knowingly:

* use `--enable-native-access` to allow +
  access to restricted JNI/FFM methods
* use `--illegal-native-access` for other code

=== JNI

Three options for illegal native access:

* `allow`
* `warn` (default on JDK 24)
* `deny`

In some future release, `deny` will become the only mode.

Prepare now by setting `--illegal-native-access=deny`.

=== Agents

What it is:

* a component that transforms byte code
* uses `java.lang.instrument` or JVM TI
* launches with JVM or attaches later ("dynamic")

=== Dynamic agents

What you need to know:

* all mechanisms for agents remain intact
* nothing changed yet
* in the future, dynamic attach will be +
  disabled by default
* enable with `-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading`

=== Dynamic agents

What you need to do:

* run your app with `-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading`
* observe closely
* investigate necessity of dynamic agents

////
=== Primitive constructors

What it is:

* `new Integer(42)`
* `new Double(42)`
* etc.

=== Primitive constructors

What you need to know:

* Valhalla wants to turn them into value types
* those have no identity
* identity-based operations need to be removed

=== Primitive constructors

What you need to do:

* `Integer.valueOf(42)`
* `Double.valueOf(42)`
* etc.
