* concurrent mark sweep GC ‚ë≠ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/363[JEP 363])

=== Cleaning house

Deprecations (for removal):

* allowed-by-default dynamic agents „âë (https://openjdk.org/jeps/451[JEP 451])
* Windows 32-bit x86 port „âë (JEPs https://openjdk.org/jeps/449[449], https://openjdk.org/jeps/479[479])
* finalization ‚ë± (https://openjdk.org/jeps/421[JEP 421])
* security manager ‚ë∞ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/411[JEP 411])
* applet API ‚ë∞ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/398[JEP 398])
* primitive wrapper constructors ‚ëØ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/390[JEP 390])
* biased locking ‚ëÆ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/374[JEP 374])

=== Agents

What it is:

* a component that transforms byte code
* uses `java.lang.instrument` or JVM TI
* launches with JVM or attaches later ("dynamic")

=== Dynamic agents

What you need to know:

* all mechanisms for agents remain intact
* nothing changed yet
* in the future, dynamic attach will be +
  disabled by default
* enable with `-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading`

=== Dynamic agents

What you need to do:

* run your app with `-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading`
* observe closely
* investigate necessity of dynamic agents

=== Finalization

What it is:

* `finalize()` methods
* a JLS/GC machinery for them

=== Finalization

What you need to know:

* you can disable with `--finalization=disabled`
* in a future release, `disabled` will be the default
* in a later release, finalization will be removed

=== Finalization

What you need to do:

* search for `finalize()` in your code and +
  replace with `try`-with-resources or `Cleaner` API
* search for `finalize()` in your dependencies and +
  help remove them
* run your app with `--finalization=disabled` and +
  closely monitor resource behavior (e.g. file handles)

=== Security Manager

What it is:

* a system of checks and permissions
* intended to safeguard security-relevant +
  code sections
* embodied by `SecurityManager`

=== Security Manager

What you need to know:

* barely used but maintenance-intensive
* already disallowed by default
* enable with `java.security.manager=allow`
* in a future release, it will be removed

=== Security Manager

What you need to do:

* observe your app with default settings +
  (‚áù security manager disallowed)
* if used, move away from security manager

=== Primitive constructors

What it is:

* `new Integer(42)`
* `new Double(42)`
* etc.

=== Primitive constructors

What you need to know:

* Valhalla wants to turn them into value types
* those have no identity
* identity-based operations need to be removed

=== Primitive constructors

What you need to do:

* `Integer.valueOf(42)`
* `Double.valueOf(42)`
* etc.
