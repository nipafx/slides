=== Java Performance

Java has really good peak performance, +
but also tends to have:

* slow startup time
* slow warmup time

=== Startup & Warmup

Early work by the runtime:

* class loading
* callsite linkage
* constant pool resolution
* interpretation
* profile gathering
* JIT compilation (C1, C2)

Can we do this ahead of time?

=== Dynamic Java

But Java is highly dynamic:

* class loading
* class redefinition
* linkage
* access control
* method dispatch
* run-time typing (e.g. casting)
* introspection
* JIT compilation, decompilation

How to AOT everything?

=== Enter AOTCache

Project Leyden introduces _AOTCache_:

* observe JVM
* capture decisions in AOTCache +
  (expansion of _CDS Archive_)
* use as "initial state" during future run
* fall back to live observation/optimization +
  if necessary and possible

=== AOT workflow

```sh
# training run (⇝ profile)
$ java -XX:AOTMode=record
       -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
# assembly phase (profile ⇝ AOTCache)
$ java -XX:AOTMode=create
       -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf
       -XX:AOTCache=app.aot
       -cp app.jar
# production run (AOTCache ⇝ performance)
$ java -XX:AOTCache=app.aot
       -cp app.jar com.example.App ...
```

(Open to improvements.)

=== AOT class loading & linking

> Improve startup time by making the classes of an application instantly available, in a loaded and linked state, when the HotSpot JVM starts.

Spring PetClinic benchmarks:

* up to ~40% startup time reduction
* AOT cache size of ~130 MB

=== AOT class loading & linking

Limitation:

* same JDK release / hardware / OS
* consistent class path for training and production
* consistent module options
* limited use of JVMTI agents

Otherwise, AOTCache is ignored.
