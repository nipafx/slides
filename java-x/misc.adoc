== Java 21 💣💥

=== Generational ZGC

Compared to other GCs, ZGC:

* optimizes ultra-low pause times
* can have higher memory footprint or higher CPU usage

In Java 21, ZGC becomes _generational_.

=== Generational Hypothesis

* most objects die young
* those who don't, grow (very) old

GCs can make use of this by tracking +
_young_ and _old generations_.

ZGC didn't do this, but can do it now with: +
`-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational`

=== Some Benchmarks

A Cassandra 4 benchmark of ZGC vs GenZGC showed:

* 4x throughput with a fixed heap or
* 1/4x heap size with stable throughput

(Probably not representative but very promising.)
