== Java 21 💣💥

{toc}

=== A simple web request

Imagine a hypothetical HTTP request:

. interpret request
. query database (_blocks_)
. process data for response

Resource utilization:

* good for 1. and 3.
* really bad for 2.

How to implement that request?

=== Synchronous

Align application's unit of concurrency (request)  +
with Java's unit of concurrency (thread):

* use thread per request
* simple to write, debug, profile
* blocks threads on certain calls
* limited number of _platform_ threads +
  ⇝ bad resource utilization +
  ⇝ low throughput

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* common CPU load: 5-30%
--

=== Asynchronous

Only use threads for actual computations:

* use non-blocking APIs (futures / reactive streams)
* harder to write, challenging to debug/profile
* incompatible with synchronous code
* shares platform threads +
  ⇝ great resource utilization +
  ⇝ high throughput

=== Conflict!

There's a conflict between:

* simplicity
* throughput

=== Nota bene

There are other conflicts:

* _design vs performance_ (⇝ Valhalla)
* _explicitness vs succinctness_ (⇝ Amber)
* _flexibility vs safety_ (⇝ Panama)
* _dynamism vs performance_ (⇝ Leyden)

=== Enter virtual threads!

A _virtual_ thread:

* is a regular `Thread`
* low memory footprint ([k]bytes)
* small switching cost
* scheduled by the Java runtime
* requires no OS thread when waiting

=== Virtual things

*Virtual memory:*

* maps large virtual address space +
  to limited physical memory
* gives illusion of plentiful memory

*Virtual threads:*

* map large number of virtual threads +
  to a small number of OS threads
* give the illusion of plentiful threads

=== Virtual things

Programs rarely care about virtual vs physical memory.

Programs need rarely care about virtual vs platform thread.

Instead:

* write straightforward (blocking) code
* runtime shares available OS threads
* reduces the cost of blocking to near zero

=== Example

```java
try (var executor = Executors
		.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
	for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
		var number = i;
		executor.submit(() -> {
			Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
			return number;
		});
	}
} // executor.close() is called implicitly, and waits
```

=== Effects

Virtual threads:

* remove "number of threads" as bottleneck
* match app's unit of concurrency to Java's

⇝ _simplicity && throughput_

=== Performance

Virtual threads aren't "faster threads":

* same number of CPU cycles
* each task takes the same time (same _latency_)

[%step]
So why bother?

=== Parallelism vs concurrency

[options="header"]
|============================================
|                | Parallelism  | Concurrency
| *Task origin*  | solution     | problem
| *Control*      | developer    | environment
| *Resource use* | coordinated  | competitive
| *Metric*       | latency      | throughput
| *Abstraction*  | CPU cores    | tasks
| *# of threads* | # of cores   | # of tasks
|============================================

=== Performance

When workload is not CPU-bound:

* start waiting as early as possible
* for as many tasks as possible

⇝ Virtual threads increase _throughput_:

* when workload is not CPU-bound
* when number of concurrent tasks is high

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* maximize progress other systems can make.
* "high": more than a few thousand

=== Server how-to

For servers:

* request handling threads are started by web framework
* frameworks will offer (easy) configuration options

We're getting there.

=== Spring Boot

Set property on 3.2 (Nov 2023):

```
spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
```

(https://quarkus.io/guides/resteasy-reactive-virtual-threads[Source])

=== Quarkus

Annotate request handling method on 3.?:

```java
@GET
@Path("api")
@RunOnVirtualThread
public String handle() {
	// ...
}
```

=== Helidon

Just works on 4.0 (currently RC1).
