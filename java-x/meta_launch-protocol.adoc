// Keeping Java approachable.

=== A Mature Ecosystem

Java is very mature:

* refined programming model
* detailed toolchain
* rich ecosystem

But this can make it hard to learn for new (Java) developers.

=== Approachable Java

Java needs to be approachable:

* for kids
* for students
* for the frontend dev
* for ML/AI folks
* etc.

Java needs an on-ramp for new (Java) developers!

=== On-Ramp to Java

On-ramp:

* simplified `main` method and class
* single-source-file execution
* multi-source-file execution

=== Simpler Code

Remove requirement of:

* `String[] args` parameter
* `main` being static
* `main` being public
* the class itself

```java
// smallest viable Main.java
void main() {
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

=== Single-File Execution

It's easy to execute that file:

```
java Main.java
```

_[Introduced in Java 11 -- https://openjdk.org/jeps/330[JEP 330]]_

=== Multi-File Execution

The program can expand:

```
MyFirstJava
 ├─ Main.java
 ├─ Helper.java
 └─ Lib
     └─ library.jar
```

Run with:

```
java -cp 'Lib/*' Main.java
```

=== Progression

Natural progression:

[%step]
* start with `main()`
* need arguments? ⇝ add `String[] args`
* need to organize code? ⇝ add methods
* need shared state? ⇝ add fields
* need more functionality? ⇝ explore JDK APIs
* even more? ⇝ explore simple libraries
* need more structure? ⇝ split into multiple files
* even more ⇝ use visibility & packages

[%step]
Doesn't even have to be that order!
