Faster feedback with fewer tools.

=== Launching A Single Source File

Compiling and running +
simple Java programs is verbose.

Not any more!

```
java HelloJava11.java
```

=== Background

How it works:

* compiles source into memory
* runs from there

Details:

* requires module _jdk.compiler_
* processes options like class/module path et al.
* interprets `@files` for easier option management

=== Use Cases

Mostly similar to `jshell`:

* easier demonstrations
* more portable examples
* experimentation with new language features +
  (combine with `--enable-preview`)

*But also: script files!*

=== Scripts

Steps towards easier scripting:

* arbitrary file names
* shebang support

=== Arbitrary File Names

Use `--source` if file doesn't end in `.java`:

```
java --source 11 hello-java-11
```

=== Shebang Support

To create "proper scripts":

* include shebang in source:
+
```sh
#!/opt/jdk-11/bin/java --source 11
```
* name script and make it executable
* execute it as any other script:
+
```sh
# from current directory:
./hello-java-11
# from PATH:
hello-java-11
```
