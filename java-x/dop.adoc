=== Programming paradigms

Paradigms often come with an +
"Everything is a ..." sentence.

> The goal of any programming paradigm is to manage complexity.

* complexity comes in many forms
* not all paradigms handle all forms equally well

‚áù "It depends"

=== Object-oriented programming

> Everything is an object

* combines state and behavior
* hinges on encapsulation
* polymorphism through inheritance

Works best when defining/upholding boundaries.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* maintenance boundaries
* versioning boundaries
* encapsulation boundaries
* compilation boundaries
* compatibility boundaries
* security boundaries
--

=== Mixed programming

Great use cases for OOP:

* boundaries between libraries and clients
* in large programs to enable modular reasoning

Consider a data-oriented approach for:

* smaller (sub)systems
* focused on data

=== Data-oriented programming

Guiding principles version 1.1:

* Model data immutably and transparently.
* Model the data, the whole data, +
  and nothing but the data.
* Make illegal states unrepresentable.
* Separate operations from data.

Based on Brian Goetz' seminal article: +
https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-oriented-programming-java/[Data Oriented Programming in Java]

=== Crawling GitHub

The app we just looked at:

* is small
* focusses on data (`Page`)
* separates operations from types

‚áù Perfect for data-oriented programming!

=== Applying DOP

> Model data immutably and transparently.

Records make that easy:

```java
public record ErrorPage(
	URI url, Exception ex) { }
```

(Just in case: You can achieve this with regular classes, too.)

=== Ensuring Immutability

Records are shallowly immutable, +
but field types may not be.

‚áù Fix that during construction.

=== Ensuring Immutability

```java
public record GitHubPrPage(..., Set<Page> links) {

	// compact constructor
	GitHubPrPage {
		links = Set.copyOf(links);
	}

}
```

=== Applying DOP

> Model the data, the whole data, +
> and nothing but the data.

There are four kinds of pages:

* error page
* external page
* GitHub issue page
* GitHub PR page

‚áù Use four records to model them!

=== Modeling the data

```java
public record ErrorPage(
	URI url, Exception ex) { }

public record ExternalPage(
	URI url, String content) { }

public record GitHubIssuePage(
	URI url, String content,
	int issueNumber, Set<Page> links) { }

public record GitHubPrPage(
	URI url, String content,
	int prNumber, Set<Page> links) { }
```

=== Modeling the data

There are additional relations between them:

* a page (load) is either successful or not
* a successful page is either external or GitHub
* a GitHub page is either for a PR or an issue

‚áù Use sealed types to model the alternatives!

=== Modeling alternatives

```java
public sealed interface Page
		permits ErrorPage, SuccessfulPage {
	URI url();
}

public sealed interface SuccessfulPage
		extends Page permits ExternalPage, GitHubPage {
	String content();
}

public sealed interface GitHubPage
		extends SuccessfulPage
		permits GitHubIssuePage, GitHubPrPage {
	Set<Page> links();
	default Stream<Page> subtree() { ... }
}
```

=== Algebraic data types

* records are _product types_
* sealed types are _sum types_

> This simple combination of mechanisms -- aggregation and choice -- is deceptively powerful

=== Applying DOP

> Make illegal states unrepresentable.

Many are already, e.g.:

* with `error` and with `content`
* with `issueNumber` and `prNumber`
* with `isseNumber` or `prNumber` but no `links`

=== Validation

‚áù Reject other illegal states in constructors.

```java
record ExternalPage(URI url, String content) {
	// compact constructor
	ExternalPage {
		Objects.requireNonNull(url);
		Objects.requireNonNull(content);
		if (content.isBlank())
			throw new IllegalArgumentException();
	}
}
```

=== Where are we?

* page "type" is explicit in Java's type
* only legal combination of data are possible
* API is self-documenting
* code is trivial to test

But where did the operations go?

=== Operations on data

> Separate operations from data.

‚áù Record methods should be limited to derived quantities.

```java
public record GitHubIssuePage(
		URI url, String content,
		int issueNumber, Set<Page> links) {

	public String toPrettyString() {
		return "üêà ISSUE #" + issueNumber;
	}

}
```

=== Operations on data

Other operations must be defined elsewhere:

* methods in other subsystems
* use pattern matching over sealed types +
  for polymorphic operations
* avoid default branch
* use record patterns to access data

‚áù This is just pattern matching.

=== Operations on data

If `toPrettyString` is defined outside of `Page`:

```java
private static String toPrettyString(Page page) {
	return switch (page) {
		case ErrorPage(var url, _)
			-> "üí• ERROR: " + url.getHost();
		case ExternalPage(var url, _)
			-> "üí§ EXTERNAL: " + url.getHost();
		case GitHubIssuePage(_, _, int issueNumber, _)
			-> "üêà ISSUE #" + issueNumber;
		case GitHubPrPage(_, _, int prNumber, _)
			-> "üêô PR #" + prNumber;
	};
}
```

=== Functional programming?!

* immutable data structures
* methods (functions?) that operate on them

Isn't this just functional programming?!

[%step]
Kind of.

=== DOP vs FP

**Functional programming:**

> Everything is a function

‚áù Focus on creating and composing functions.

---

**Data-oriented programming:**

> Model data as data.

‚áù Focus on correctly modeling the data.

=== DOP vs OOP

**OOP is not dead (again):**

* valuable for complex entities or rich libraries
* use whenever encapsulation is needed
* still a good default on high level

**DOP --  consider when:**

* mainly handling outside data
* working with simple or ad-hoc data
* data and behavior should be separated

=== Data-oriented programming

Use Java's strong typing to model data as data:

* use classes to represent data, particularly:
** data as data with records
** alternatives with sealed classes
* use methods (separately) to model behavior, particularly:
** exhaustive `switch` without `default`
** pattern matching to destructure polymorphic data

=== Guiding principles

* model the data, the whole data, +
  and nothing but the data
* data is immutable
* validate at the boundary
* make illegal states unrepresentable
