// Going from UTF-16 to ISO-8859-1.

=== Strings and memory

* 20% - 30% of heap are `char[]` for `String`
* a `char` is UTF-16 code unit ⇝ 2 bytes
* most strings only require ISO-8859-1 ⇝ 1 byte

*10% - 15% of memory is wasted!*

=== Compact Strings

For Java 9, `String` was changed:

* uses `byte[]` instead of `char[]`
* bytes per character:
** 1 if _all_ characters are ISO-8859-1
** 2 otherwise

Only possible because `String` makes +
defensive copies of all arguments.

=== Performance

Simple benchmark: +
(by https://shipilev.net/[Aleksey Shipilëv])

```java
String method = generateString(size);

public String work() {
	return "Calling method \"" + method + "\"";
}
```

Depending on circumstances:

* throughput 1.4x
* garbage less 1.85x
