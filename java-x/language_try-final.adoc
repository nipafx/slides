// Making `try`-with-resources blocks cleaner.

=== Useless Variable

```java
void doSomethingWith(Connection connection)
		throws Exception {
	try (Connection c = connection) {
		c.doSomething();
	}
}
```

Why is `c` necessary?

=== Why is `c` necessary?

* target of `close()` must be obvious +
‚áù resource should not be reassigned
* easiest if resource is final
* easiest if resource must be assigned +
and can be made implicitly final

```java
try (Connection c = connection)
```

=== Effectively Final Resource

But since Java 8 we have _effectively final_!

This works in Java 9:

```java
void doSomethingWith(Connection connection)
		throws Exception {
	try (connection) {
		connection.doSomething();
	}
}

```

* compiler knows that `connection` is not reassigned
* developers know what _effectively final_ means
