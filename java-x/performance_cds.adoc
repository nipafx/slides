Improving application launch times.

=== Class-Data

JVM steps to execute a class's bytecode:

* looks up class in JAR
* loads bytecode
* verifies bytecode
* stores class-data in +
internal data structure

This takes quite some time.

If classes don't change, the resulting +
class-data is always the same!

=== Class-Data Sharing

Idea behind class-data sharing:

* create class-data once
* dump it into an archive
* reuse the archive in future launches +
  (file is mapped into memory)

=== Effects

My experiments with a large desktop app +
(focusing on classes required for launch):

* archive has 250 MB for ~24k classes
* launch time reduced from 15s to 12s

*Bonus*: Archive can be shared across JVMs.

=== Class-Data Sharing

Two variants:

CDS:: just for JDK classes
AppCDS:: JDK + application classes

=== CDS - Step #1

Create JDK archive on Java 10/11:

```sh
# possibly as root
java -Xshare:dump
```

Java 12+ downloads include +
CDS archive for JDK classes.

=== CDS - Step #2

Use the archive:

```sh
$ java
	-Xshare:on
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
	org.example.Main
```

If archive is missing or faulty:

* `-Xshare:on` fails fast
* `-Xshare:auto` (default) ignores archive

(Slides rely on default, i.e. no `-Xshare`.)

=== AppCDS

Create an AppCDS archive:

* manually on Java 10+
* dynamically on Java 13+

First manually, then dynamically.

=== AppCDS - Step #0

To manually create an AppCDS archive, +
first create a list of classes

```sh
$ java
	-XX:DumpLoadedClassList=classes.lst
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
	org.example.Main
```

Then, `classes.lst` contains +
slash-separated names of loaded classes.

=== AppCDS - Step #1

Use the list to create the archive:

```sh
$ java
	-Xshare:dump
	-XX:SharedClassListFile=classes.lst
	-XX:SharedArchiveFile=app-cds.jsa
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
```

Creates archive `app-cds.jsa`.

=== AppCDS - Step #2

Use the archive:

```sh
$ java
	-XX:SharedArchiveFile=app-cds.jsa
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
	org.example.Main
```

=== Dynamic AppCDS

Java 13 can create archive when +
program exits (without crash):

* steps #0 and #1 are replaced by:
+
```sh
$ java
	-XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=dyn-cds.jsa
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
	org.example.Main
```
* step #2 as before:
+
```sh
$ java
	-XX:SharedArchiveFile=app-cds.jsa
	# [... class path for app and deps ...]
	org.example.Main
```

=== Dynamic AppCDS

The dynamic archive:

* builds on the JDK-archive
* contains all loaded app/lib classes
* including those loaded by +
  user-defined class loaders

=== Heed The Class Path

What are the two biggest challenges +
in software development?

[%step]
. naming
. cache invalidation
. off-by-one errors

=== Heed The Class Path

The archive is a cache!

It's invalid when:

* a JAR is updated
* class path is reordered
* a JAR is added +
  (unless when appended)

=== Heed The Class Path

To invalidate the archive:

* during creation:
** Java stores used class path in archive
** class path may not contain wild cards
** class path may not contain exploded JARs
* when used: +
** Java checks whether stored path +
   is prefix of current path

=== Module Path?

Class path, class path... +
what about the module path?

____
In this release, CDS cannot archive classes from user-defined modules (such as those specified in `--module-path`).
We plan to add that support in a future release.
