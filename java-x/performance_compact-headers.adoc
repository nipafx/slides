=== Object information

Runtime needs to track information per object:

* *garbage collection*: forwarding pointers and object ages
* *type system*: object's class
* *locking*: unlocked, light-weight, or heavy-weight locks
* *hashing*: identity hash code, once computed

This is stored in the _object header_.

=== Object header

On 64bit hardware:

```
95-64 .........................HHHHHHH
63-32 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.AAAA.TT
31- 0 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
```

* `A`: GC age
* `C`: class word (compressed)
* `H`: hash code
* `T`: tag bits

=== Object Overhead

This incurs overhead:

* objects tend to be small +
  (many workloads average 256-512 bits)
* header size is noticable +
  (15-30% on such workloads)

⇝ This is worth optimizing.

=== Complications

The aforementioned subsystems are +
complicated _and_ performance-sensitive.

I've only told you the easy part of object headers: +
locking operations can override upper 62 bits.

=== Compressed headers

Project Lilliput achieved first milestone:

```
63-32 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHH
31- 0 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHVVVVAAAASTT
```

* `A`: GC age
* `C`: class word
* `H`: hash code
* `S`: self-forwarding
* `T`: tag bits
* `V`: Valhalla bits

=== Effects

These changes have several downstream effects:

* locking operations no longer override
* class word is now much smaller and encded differently
* GC forwarding operations become more complex

In special cases, these may be detrimental to performance.

=== Benchmarks

> * In one setting, the SPECjbb2015 benchmark uses https://github.com/rkennke/talks/blob/master/Lilliput-FOSDEM-2025.pdf[22% less heap space and 8% less CPU time.]
> * In another setting, the number of garbage collections done by SPECjbb2015 is https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8350457?focusedId=14766358&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-14766358[reduced by 15%], with both the G1 and Parallel collectors.
> * A highly parallel JSON parser benchmark runs in https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1jptiv3/xxusecompactobjectheaders_is_your_new_turbo/?rdt=40432[10% less time].

=== Try it out!

Add flag:

```
-XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders
```

Report observations to https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/hotspot-dev[hotspot-dev]!

This is vital to:

* improve performance, specifically edge cases
* decide whether this becomes default/only header encoding

=== Note

Interaction with other features:

* compressed class pointers must be enabled (default)
* stack locking must be disabled (default)
