A modern HTTP/2 client out of the box.

=== Basic Flow

To send a request and get a response:

* use builder to create immutable `HttpClient`
* use builder to create immutable `HttpRequest`
* pass request to client to receive `HttpResponse`

=== Building a Client

```java
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
	.version(HTTP_2)
	.connectTimeout(ofSeconds(5))
	.followRedirects(ALWAYS)
	.build();
```

More options:

* proxy
* SSL context/parameters
* authenticator
* cookie handler

=== Building a Request

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
	.GET()
	.uri(URI.create("https://nipafx.dev"))
	.setHeader("header-name", "header-value")
	.build();
```

* more HTTP methods (duh!)
* individual timeout
* individual HTTP version
* request `"100 CONTINUE"` before sending body
* create prefilled builder from existing request â‘¯

=== Receiving a Response

```java
// the generic `String`...
HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(
	request,
	// ... comes from this body handler ...
	BodyHandlers.ofString());
// ... and defines `body()`s return type
String body = response.body();
```

* status code, headers, SSL session
* request
* intermediate responses +
  (redirection, authentication)

=== Reactive?

Great, but where's the reactive sauce?

Three places:

* send request asynchronously
* provide request body with +
  `Publisher<ByteBuffer>`
* receive response body with +
  `Subscriber<String>` or +
  `Subscriber<List<ByteBuffer>>`

=== Asynchronous Request

Submit request to thread pool until completes:

```java
CompletableFuture<String> responseBody = client
	.sendAsync(request, BodyHandlers.ofString())
	.thenApply(this::logHeaders)
	.thenApply(HttpResponse::body);
```

* uses "a default executor" to field requests +
// (currently `Executors::newCachedThreadPool`)
* pool can be defined when client is built with +
  `HttpClient.Builder.executor(Executor)`

=== Reactive Request Body

If a request has a long body, +
no need to prepare it in its entirety:

```java
Publisher<ByteBuffer> body = // ...
HttpRequest post = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
	.POST(BodyPublishers.fromPublisher(body))
	.build();
client.send(post, BodyHandlers.ofString())
```

* `client` subscribes to `body`
* as `body` publishes byte buffers, +
  `client` sends them over the wire

=== Reactive Response Body

If a response has a long body, +
no need to wait before processing:

```java
Subscriber<String> body = // ...
HttpResponse<Void> response = client.send(
	request,
	BodyHandlers.fromLineSubscriber(subscriber));
```

* `client` subscribes `body` to itself
* as `client` receives response bytes, +
  it parses to lines and passes to `body`

=== Reactive Benefits

Benefits of reactive +
request/response bodies:

* receiver applies backpressure:
** on requests, `client`
** on responses, `body`
* `body` controls memory usage
* early errors lead to partial processing
* need "reactive tools" to create `body` +
  from higher-level Java objects (e.g. `File`)

=== Web Sockets

*Short version:*

* there's a class `WebSocket`
* `send[Text|Binary|...]` methods +
return `CompletableFuture`
* socket calls `Listener` methods +
`on[Text|Binary|...]`

(`WebSocket` and `Listener` behave like +
`Subscription` and `Subscriber`.)

*No long version.* ðŸ˜›
