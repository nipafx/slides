=== Why upgrade?

Costs of running on old versions:

* support contract for Java
* waning support in libraries / frameworks

=== Why upgrade?

Costs of not running on new versions:

* lower productivity
* less observability and performance +
  (more on that later)
* less access to talent
* bigger upgrade costs

=== Why upgrade?

> Resistence is futile.

=== How to upgrade?

Preparations:

* stick to supported APIs
* stick to standardized behavior
* stick to well-maintained projects
* keep dependencies and tools up to date
* stay ahead of removals (`jdeprscan`)
* build on many JDK versions

=== How to upgrade?

Prepare by building on multiple JDK versions:

* your baseline version
* every supported version since then
* latest version
* EA build of next version

=== How to upgrade?

It's not necessary to build …

* … each commit on all versions
* … the whole project on all versions

Build as much as feasible.

=== What about LTS?

Within OpenJDK, there is no LTS.

⇝ has no impact on features, reliability, etc.

It's a vendor-centric concept +
to offer continuous fixes +
(usually for money).

> You're paying not to get new features.
