=== Generational ZGC

Compared to other GCs, ZGC:

* optimizes for ultra-low pause times
* can have higher memory footprint or higher CPU usage

In JDK 21, ZGC became _generational_.

=== Generational Hypothesis

* most objects die young
* those who don't, grow (very) old

GCs can make use of this by tracking +
_young_ and _old generations_.

ZGC didn't do this, but can do it now.

=== Reports

Netflix published https://netflixtechblog.com/bending-pause-times-to-your-will-with-generational-zgc-256629c9386b[a blog post] on their adoption.

=== Default

Generational mode is:

* the default on JDK 23
* the only mode on JDK 24+

`-XX:+UseZGC`

(Default GC is still G1.)
