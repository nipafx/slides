=== Writing JavaDoc

Writing simple JavaDoc is great!

Writing more complex documentation...

* where does `<p>` go?
* do we need `</p>`?
* code snippets/blocks are cumbersome
* lists are verbose
* tables are terrible
* ...

[%step]
I blame HTML!

=== Markdown

Markdown is more pleasant to write:

* no `<p>` nor `</p>`
* code snippts/blocks are simple
* lists are simple
* tables are terrible (but less so)
* embedding HTML is straightforward

Markdown is widely used and known.

=== Markdown in JavaDoc

Java now allows Markdown JavaDoc:

* each line starts with `///`
* most Commonmark 0.3 syntax works
* links to program elements use extended +
  reference link syntax: `[text][element]`
* JavaDoc tags work as usual

_[Introduced in Java 23 -- https://openjdk.org/jeps/467[JEP 467]]_

=== Why /// ?

Wouldn't this be nice:

```java
/**md
 *
 * Markdown here...
 *
 */
```

=== Why /// ?

No - reason #1:

```java
/**md
 *
 * Here's a list:
 *
    * item #1
    * item #1
 *
 */
```

(The leading `*` in JavaDoc is optional.)

=== Why /// ?

No - reason #2:

```java
/**md
 *
 * ```java
 * /* a Java inline comment */
 * ```
 *
 */
```

(`/****` can't contain `*/`.)

=== Why /// ?

`///`:

* no such issues
* doesn't require new Java syntax +
  (`//` already "escapes" parsing)
