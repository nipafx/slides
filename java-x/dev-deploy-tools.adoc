=== Fast prototyping Java code with jshell

[%step]
* Quickly try, debug and learn Java and its APIs.
* Experiment with Java by bypassing the compile stage.
* Get immediate feedback on your code.
* Exposes a programmatic API

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* You can enter program elements one at a time, immediately see the result, and make adjustments as needed.

=== Highlighting deprecated elements, variables and keywords

[%step]
```java
jshell> var check = new Boolean("true");
|  Warning:
|  Boolean(java.lang.String) in java.lang.Boolean
|  has been deprecated and marked for removal
|  var check = new Boolean("true");
|              ^-----------------^
check ==> true
```

=== JDK tool access in jshell

[%step]

* `jshell` supports loading scripts.
* Scripts can be local files or one of the predefined scripts.
* Scripts may hold any valid code snippets or `jshell` commands.

=== Predefined jshell scripts

[cols="25h,~"]
|===
|Script |Description

|DEFAULT
|Loads the default entries, which are commonly used as imports.

|JAVASE
|Imports all Java SE packages.

|PRINTING
|Defines `print,println,` and `printf` as `jshell` methods for use within the tool.

|TOOLING ã‰‘
|Defines `javac, jar`, and other methods for running JDK tools within `jshell`.

|===


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The JShell tool for interactive exploration of Java code has been enhanced with a new predefined script, TOOLING.
--

=== Loading TOOLING script

*  When you start jshell

[%step]
```
jshell TOOLING
```

[%step]
*  Inside a `jshell` session

[%step]
```
jshell> /open TOOLING
```
[%step]
_[JDK tools in jshell ã‰‘ -- https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8306560[JDK-8306560]]_

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* But when the same computation is done with an "+=" operator (or also with similar operators, like "-="), then this error does not occur.
--

=== Using the TOOLING script

[%step]
* Check available tools
+
```
jshell> tools()
```
* Execute a tool command in a `jshell` session
+
```
jshell> run("javac", "-version")
jshell> javac("-version")

javac 21
```

=== What tool would you use for local prototyping, testing or debugging a client-server setup?

[%step]
_[Introducing jwebserver â‘± -- https://openjdk.org/jeps/408[JEP 408]]_

=== Use cases for jwebserver

Web development testing, to simulate locally a client-server setup.

```
jwebserver

Binding to loopback by default.
For all interfaces use "-b 0.0.0.0" or "-b ::".
Serving /cwd and subdirectories on 127.0.0.1 port 8000
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

=== Use cases for jwebserver

Web-service prototyping or application testing.

```
jwebserver -d api -p 9000

Binding to loopback by default.
For all interfaces use "-b 0.0.0.0" or "-b ::".
Serving /api and subdirectories on 127.0.0.1 port 9000
URL http://127.0.0.1:9000/
127.0.0.1 - - [01/Feb/2024:14:27:26 +0100]
"GET /activity.json HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Web-service or application testing, where you use static files as API stubs in a directory structure to mirror RESTful URLs and contain dummy data.
--

=== Use cases for jwebserver

Search a directory on a remote server from your local machine.

```
jwebserver -b 0.0.0.0

Serving /work and subdirectories
on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) port 8000
URL http://192.168.178.41:8000/
```

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Informal browsing and sharing of files across systems to, e.g., search a directory on a remote server from your local machine.
--

=== Working with the Simple Web Server API

The `SimpleFileServer` class supports the creation of:

* file server
* file handler
* an output filter

[%step]
_[Working with the Simple Web Server -- https://inside.java/2021/12/06/working-with-the-simple-web-server[inside.java article]]_


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* While the command-line tool is useful, you can use the Simple Web Server (i.e., server, handler, and filter) with existing code via its API.
--

=== Distributing modular applications

Let's assume the following project structure:

```
src/main/java
â”œâ”€â”€ module-info.java
â””â”€â”€ org
    â””â”€â”€ example
        â””â”€â”€ HelloWorldFX.java

cat src/main/java/module-info.java
module hellofx {
	requires javafx.controls;
	exports org.example;
}
```

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Generate file with `.jmod` extension that encapsulate a set of compiled Java classes, resources and other related files.
--

=== Make performant module files

`jmod` creates module files that encapsulate a set of +
compiled Java classes, resources and other related files.

[%step]
```
jmod create --class-path mods/helloworldfx \
    --main-class org.example.HelloWorldFX \
    --module-version 1.0.0 \
    --compress zip-9 hellofx.jmod
```

=== Specify a module's compression level

Use `--compress` command line option:

* accepts values between `zip-[0-9]`
* `zip-0` provides no compression,
* `zip-9` provides the best compression
* the default compression value is `zip-6`

[%step]
_[jmod --compress option -- https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8293499[JDK-8293499]]_

=== Why does that matter?

You can further create an optimal application image.

[%step]
```
jlink --launcher hello=hellofx/example.HelloWorldFX \
    --module-path $PATH_TO_JMODS:/hellofx.jmod \
    --add-modules hellofx \
    --output my-app
```

=== Packaging Java Applications
image::images/stun.gif[background, size=cover]

=== Intro to jpackage

* Packages self-contained Java applications.
* Prior JDK19, installing a jpackaged app was system-wide.
* For modular applications, `jpackage` will automatically run `jlink` and generate a runtime with the modules needed.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Until JDK 19, installation of a jpackaged application was system-wide because startup parameters were stored in the system-wide installation location.
--

=== Using jpackage

```
jpackage --input target/ --name JDemoApp \
    --type app-image --main-jar JDemoApp.jar \
    --main-class JDemoApp
```

[%step]
```
JDemoApp.app/
  Contents/
    Info.plist
    MacOS/               // Application launchers
      JDemoApp
    Resources/           // Icons, etc.
    app/
      JDemoApp.cfg     // Config info, done by jpackage
      JDemoApp.jar     // copied from --input directory
    runtime/           // Java runtime image
```

=== Installation of a jpackaged application after JDK 19

Application launcher will search for `.cfg` in user-specific folders.

```shell
Linux
    ~/.local/${PACKAGE_NAME}
    ~/.${PACKAGE_NAME}
macOS
    ~/Library/Application Support/${PACKAGE_NAME}
Windows
    %LocalAppData%\%PACKAGE_NAME%
    %AppData%\%PACKAGE_NAME%

# ${PACKAGE_NAME} and %PACKAGE_NAME%
# refer to jpackaged application name.
```

=== Installation of a jpackaged application after JDK 19

Application launcher will look up the `.cfg` file:
[%step]
* In user-specific directories,
* From the installation directory if `.cfg` file is not found,
* From the application image directory if the application launcher is executed from application image.
