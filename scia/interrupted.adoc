== Structured Concurrency in&nbsp;Action

{toc}

=== Blocking methods

Two kinds of methods:

* most depend on local resources
* some depend on an external event ‚áù _blocking_

External events may never happen, +
so blocking methods should be cancelable.

=== Interruption

_Interruption_ is that cancellation mechanism:

* on the level of threads
* cooperative
* interrupted method determines +
  how to handle interruption

=== Interruption API

Interrupted status is represented by a boolean flag.

Methods on `Thread`:

* ‚ö°Ô∏è `interrupt()` interrupts the thread
* üîç `isInterrupted()` queries the flag
* ‚ö†Ô∏è `interrupted()` queries _and clears_ the flag

Also: `InterruptedException`.

=== InterruptedException

Thrown by well-behaved blocking methods. +
(JDK methods reset interrupted status.)

When catching `InterruptedException`:

* clean up (quickly)
* cede computation
* if possible, rethrow
* otherwise, reinterrupt thread +
  (with `interrupt()`)
