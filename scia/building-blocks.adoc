=== Caveat

I haven't learned much since the last caveat. ðŸ§‚ðŸ§‚

=== Reactive Streams

Typical properties:

* non-blocking (asynchronous)
* event-based
* backpressure strategies
* streaming API
* many reusable operators

Virtual threads with blocking data structures +
can replace much of that.

=== Reusable Operators

Reactive APIs come with many reusable operators.

* some map to language constructs
* some map to data structures
* some are avilable in other libraries
* some may need to be (re)implemented

=== Code

Code, code, code, code
