== Structured Concurrency in&nbsp;Action

{toc}

=== Virtual thread potential

Virtual threads are cheap and plentiful:

* no pooling necessary
* allow thread per task
* allow liberal creation +
  of threads for subtasks

⇝ Enable new concurrency programming model.

=== A first step

Whenever you need concurrent subtasks, +
spawn virtual threads for each:

```java
private static final ExecutorService VIRTUAL =
	Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()

void handle(Request request, Response response)
		throws InterruptedException {
	var taskA = VIRTUAL.submit(this::doA);
	var taskB = VIRTUAL.submit(this::doB);
	response.send(taskA.get() + taskB.get());
}
```

[%step]
But we can do (much) better!

=== Structured programming

Emerged when the sea of statements and GOTOs +
became unmaintainable:

* prescribes control structures
* prescribes single entry point +
  and clearly defined exit points
* influenced languages and runtimes

The stricter approach made code (much) clearer!

=== Unstructured concurrency

```java
private static final ExecutorService VIRTUAL =
	Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()

void handle(Request request, Response response)
		throws InterruptedException {

	// what's the relationship between
	// this and the two spawned threads?
	// what happens when one of them fails?
	var taskA = VIRTUAL.submit(this::doA);
	var taskB = VIRTUAL.submit(this::doB);

	// what if we only need the faster one?
	response.send(taskA.get() + taskB.get());
}
```

⇝ Thread lifecycle is simple:

* starts when task begins
* ends on completion

⇝ Enables parent-child/sibling relationships +
  and logical grouping of threads.

=== In action

To put the API into action, we will perform tasks, +
that are represented by _our_ (!) class `Task`.

Methods:

* `public void run(Behavior)`: changes state
* `public String compute(Behavior)`:
** changes state
** returns result
* `public void rollBack()`: resets state

`Behavior` can be `Run`, `Fail`, etc.

=== Task states
