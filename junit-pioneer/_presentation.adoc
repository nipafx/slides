== JUnit Pioneer

JUnit Pioneer -- https://junit-pioneer.org[junit-pioneer.org]:

* provides extensions for https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/[JUnit 5] and its https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[Jupiter API]
* small project (5k lines of code, 4 maintainers)

Why is it interesting?

* JUnit 5 is thrilling
* grew a (small) community on Twitch
* neat build and Git practices
* one-click releases
* automatic website build

=== Lots to talk about!

* JUnit 5 and its extension model
* Pioneer's extensions
* Pioneer's mission statement and history
* how live-streaming on Twitch grew a community
* organizational style and contribution guide
* code style, Git practices, release considerations
* how we use Shipkit and GitHub actions for one-click releases
* building the website with Jekyll and GitHub actions

== JUnit Extensions

Crash course to JUnit 5 and +
its extension model.

(This is _very_ incomplete!)

=== JUnit 5

A simple test:

```java
class JUnit5Test {

	@Test
	void test() {
		assertTrue(true);
	}

}
```

* need an API to write tests against
* need an engine that executes them

=== Separation Of Concerns

Separation of concerns in JUnit 5:

. an API to write tests against
. an API to discover and run tests
[loweralpha]
.. specific engine per variant of tests +
(e.g. JUnit 4 or JUnit 5)
.. orchestration of engines
.. API between them

=== Architecture

image::images/architecture-limited-lean.png[style="diagram", width=550]

=== JUnit Jupiter

* defines test API
* defines extension API
* contains engine for them

Often referred to as "JUnit 5".

=== Extension Model

Jupiter allows seamless extensions:

```java
@Test
@DisabledOnFriday
void failingTest() {
	assertTrue(false);
}
```

Cornerstones:

* extensions interact with _extension points_
* extensions must be registered +
  (possibly with annotations)

=== Extension Points

An incomplete list:

* instance post processor
* `@BeforeAll` and `@BeforeEach`
* execution condition
* exception handling
* `@AfterEach` and `@AfterAll`

Each represented by an interface, +
e.g. `ExecutionCondition`.

=== Extension Example

How to disable tests on Friday:

```java
public class DisabledOnFridayCondition
		implements ExecutionCondition {

	@Override
	public ConditionEvaluationResult evaluate(/**/) {
		if (isFriday())
			return ConditionEvaluationResult
				.disabled("Weekend! 🕺🏾💃🏼");
		else
			return ConditionEvaluationResult
				.enabled("Run the test 😬");
	}

}
```

=== Registering Annotations

Jupiter is aware of https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Annotations/Meta-Annotations[meta annotations]. +
⇝ We can create our own annotations!

```java
// [... more annotations ...]
@ExtendWith(DisabledOnFridayCondition.class)
public @interface DisabledOnFriday { }

@Test
@DisabledOnFriday
void failingTest() {
	assertTrue(false);
}
```


== Pioneer Extensions

An incomplete list:

* Cartesian products for parameters
* set default locale
* set system properties
* publish issue information
* retry failed tests

Let's see some incomplete examples!

=== Cartesian Product

```java
@CartesianProductTest
@CartesianValueSource(ints = { 1, 2 })
@CartesianValueSource(strings = { "A", "B" })
void test(int number, String character) {
    // called four times - with:
	// (1, "A") (1, "B") (2, "A") (2, "B")
}
```

=== Default Locale

```java
@Test
@DefaultLocale(language = "en")
void test() {
    assertThat(Locale.getDefault())
        .isEqualTo(new Locale("en"));
}
```

=== System Properties

```java
@Test
@ClearSystemProperty(key = "user.name")
@SetSystemProperty(key = "user.dir", value = "...")
void test() {
    assertThat(System.getProperty("user.name"))
		.isNull();
    assertThat(System.getProperty("user.dir"))
		.isEqualTo("...");
}
```

=== Issue Information

Mark tests that belong to issues:

```java
@Test
@Issue("REQ-123")
void test() {
    // a test for the issue "REQ-123"
}
```

Process information after execution:

// https://yuml.me/nipafx/edit/junit-pioneer-issue-test-suite
image::images/issue-test-suite.png[role="diagram"]

=== Retrying Tests

```java
@RetryingTest(3)
void test() {
    // if 1st, 2nd, or 3rd execution passes,
	// the test passes; otherwise fails
}
```

=== Others

We have a few more:

* ranges for parameters
* set default time zone
* set environment variables
* disable specific parameterized tests
* publish report entries
* mocking standard I/O

Isn't this all a bit random?

⇝ Yes!


== JUnit Pioneer

Mission statement:

> JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for JUnit 5 and its Jupiter API.
> It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.
> It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

=== JUnit Pioneer

We want to:

* provide helpful extensions
* be open to experimental ideas
* catch-all extensions that are too small +
  to be their own project

=== JUnit Pioneer

We are:

* Matthias Bünger -- Bishuemaster
* Mihály Verhás -- Chief Developer
* Nicolai Parlog -- Benevolent Dictator
* Simon Schottner -- Build Engineer

Plus about a dozen contribtors, +
some of them recurring.

=== JUnit Pioneer

We have:

* 4.7k lines of production code
* 5.9k lines of test code
* 26 releases, 5 since 1.0.0

// TODO: more meaningful stats?

=== How did we get here?

Sounds good? Not so fast!

* this is a hobby project
* life gets in the way
* for 3 years, little happened

=== Twitch

2019::
* Nicolai discovers Twitch
* does a few live streams in spring
* decides to stream regularly in December

2020::
* 30 JUnit Pioneer streams
* usually 3 to 5 hours

=== Twitch

Expected effects:

* commits Nicolai to ~10 h/month for Pioneer
* interests Java devs

=== Twitch

Unexpected effects:

* gives viewers insight into project
* viewers help in their areas of expertise
** in Twitch chat
** on GitHub
* viewers pick up small issues
* viewers become contributors
* contributors become maintainers

=== Twitch

Thanks to live-streaming this one-man show, +
became a real project:

* in April 2020, Simon and Matthias +
  became maintainers
* in November 2020, Mihaly joined

A few contributors also stop by the stream +
(and always enjoy when Nicolai reviews their PRs).


== Project Management

* fostering contributions
* doing the dirty work
* communication & prioritization
* managing expectations

=== Contributing Without Coding

* creating, labeling, commenting, prioritizing, organizing issues (Nicolai can "just stream")
* reviewing changes for technical merits and completeness
* following up with other projects
* remembering/updating configuration

=== Issues - Preparing 1.0

* no cohesive feature set ~> no good point for 1.0
* instead prepare everything for users and contributors:
** build pipeline
** website
** documentation
** etc.
* place "clean-up issues" in milestone "Cleaner Pioneer", eventually "1.0"

=== Issues - Since Then

• Kanban board

=== Pull Requests

* not from main
* checklist, e.g. tests, documentation, contribution, etc.
* squashing commits

=== Squashing Commits

* allows contributors to use Git however they like it
* keeps commit history very clean
* allows for very informative commit messages (part of the PR)

=== Contribution Guide

* CONTRIBUTING.md
* describes all process steps in detail
* for contributors
* for maintainers

=== Fostering Contributions

* open source contribution guide
* code style (packages, naming, `Optional`)
* consistency is king, simplicity is king kong
** always use AssertJ
** always use `Optional`
** always squash commits
* Git configuration
* documentation guide
* appreciation
** tone
** quick replies
** thank for contributions
** code of conduct (not yet)
** list of contributors

=== Doing The Dirty Work

* leave features to others
* fix bugs
* set up build, website, etc.
* tackle hard issues (annotation, threading)

=== Communcation Guide

=== Protecting Maintaiers

* what/when do maintainers do
* the buck stops


== Coding

* architecture
* dependency management
* how to test a test framework

=== Architecture

JUnit Pioneer has high-end architecture:

```sh
📦 org.junitpioneer
├─ 📦 internal  # our utilities - internal
├─ 📦 jupiter   # most of our extensions
│  ├─ 📦 issue  # issue impl - internal
│  └─ 📦 params # ext. re parameterized tests
└─ 📦 vintage   # ext. re to JUnit 4
```

We mirror Jupiter's packages:

* `org.junit.jupiter.api`
* `org.junit.jupiter.params`

=== Internal packages

Speaking of internal packages:

* we created two (e.g. for annotations)
* we don't want people to use them

How?

* ⚠️ one package is called `internal`
* ⚠️ package info says it's internal
* 🛑 we ship modular JAR that +
  doesn't export these packages

=== More Architecture

To make navigation easier, +
we also have rules for:

* naming classes
* organizing top-level types +
  (e.g. repeatable annotations)
* how to use Jupiter's `Namespace`

No rocket science, but need to be upheld.

=== Dependency Management

Projects have enough problems +
with dependencies.

We don't want to add to that.

⇝ JUnit 5 should be our only +
runtime dependency.

=== In Practice

The `@Issue` extension:

* collects information about tests
* wants to create a report

But reports could be XML, JSON, etc.

* "need" dependencies for that
* probably not many users use `@Issue`

What now?

=== Resolution

Dependency inversion to the rescue +
(via Java's `ServiceLoader`):

* Pioneer declares interface `IssueProcessor`
* users implement it and register implementation
* Pioneer finds implementations and passes info

image::images/issue-service-loader.png[role="diagram"]

=== Tests²

How do you test a test framework?

* want to verify error behavior
* want to test behavior outside of tests +
  (e.g. report entry publication)

We often write tests that run _other_ tests +
and then evaluate their results.

=== Tests²

JUnit 5 has good support for that:

* we added a few usability methods
* we created our own assertions

```java
ExecutionResults results = executeTestMethod(
	MethodLevelInitializationFailureTestCase.class,
	"shouldFailMissingConfiguration");
assertThat(results)
	.hasSingleFailedTest()
	.withExceptionInstanceOf(/*...*/);
```

=== Tests²

Thread safety:

* all our extensions should be thread-safe
* to test that, we run our tests in parallel
* that's not always fun

We're mostly sure, we got this. 😬


== Build Pipeline

* Gradle, Shipkit, Bintray, GitHub Actions
* Spotless, SonarQube, test coverage
* one-click release
* versioning
* website


== Challenges

* Bintray
* available time
