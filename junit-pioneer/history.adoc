== JUnit Pioneer

Mission statement:

> JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for JUnit 5 and its Jupiter API.
> It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.
> It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

=== JUnit Pioneer

We want to:

* provide helpful extensions
* be open to experimental ideas
* catch-all extensions that are too small +
  to be their own project

=== JUnit Pioneer

We are:

* Matthias Bünger -- Bishuemaster
* Mihály Verhás -- Chief Developer
* Nicolai Parlog -- Benevolent Dictator
* Simon Schottner -- Build Engineer

Plus about a dozen contribtors, +
some of them recurring.

=== JUnit Pioneer

We have:

* 4.7k lines of production code
* 5.9k lines of test code
* 26 releases, 5 since 1.0.0
* Java 8 as requirement
* Java 9-15 supported

=== How did we get here?

Sounds good? Not so fast!

* this is a hobby project
* life gets in the way
* for 3 years, little happened

Thanks to live-streaming, we became a small community.

In November 2020, we got together for donations:

we'll finally meet for drinks.

Thanks to live-streaming, this one-man show, +
became a real project:

* in April 2020, Simon and Matthias +
  became maintainers
* in November 2020, Mihaly joined

A few contributors also stop by the stream +
(and always enjoy when Nicolai reviews their PRs).
