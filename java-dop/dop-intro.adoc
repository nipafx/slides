=== Data-Oriented Programming

Data-oriented programming:

* focusses on data (Duh!) 
* views programs as series of transformations

Consider it for:

* smaller (sub)systems
* that mainly process input to putput

=== Guiding Principles

Brian Goetz formulated them in June 2022: +

I offered an updated version in May 2024: +
https://inside.java/2024/05/23/dop-v1-1-introduction/[Data-Oriented Programming in Java - Version 1.1]

=== Data-Oriented Programming

Version 1.1:

* Model data immutably and transparently.
* Model the data, the whole data, +
  and nothing but the data.
* Make illegal states unrepresentable.
* Separate operations from data.
