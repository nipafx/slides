=== Programming Concepts

Java is a great OOP language.

OOP is a great paradigm for large systems.

But is OOP the best paradigm to learn first?

=== Object-Oriented Programming

// argue via benefits of OOP (why you would reach for those tools) instead of mechanics

OOP hinges on:

* abstraction of the domain through classes
* combination of state and behavior
* encapsulation and visibility
* inheritance (at least of types)

Neither easy nor necessary for simple programs.

=== Simple Programs

Programming can be immediately useful:

* automation
* data analysis
* visualization
* interactive media

Let learners write simple, useful programs!

⇝ Such programs rarely need OOP.

=== Terminal Interaction

Simple programs usually interact via terminal.

Use `java.lang.IO` instead of `System.{in|out}`:

* `void print(Object)` & `void println(Object)` to write
* `String readln(String)` to read input

=== Terminal Interaction

```java
void main() {
	var name = IO.readln("Please enter your name: ");
	IO.println("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}
```

```sh
# on JDK 25
$ java Main.java
> Please enter your name: Nicolai
> Nice to meet you, Nicolai
```

=== Focusing on Data

Simple programs often focus on data:

* reading data from disk or remote
* parsing various data formats
* representation of data as types
* mass-processing data
* visualizing data
* writing data to disk or a remote

=== Reading Local Data

NIO.2 makes reading text files straightforward:

```java
var transactions = Path.of("transactions.csv");
for (var line : Files.readAllLines(transactions)) {
	// ...
}
```

=== Reading Remote Data

HTTP/2 client makes reading remote data +
(relatively) straightforward:

```java
var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
var request = HttpRequest
		.newBuilder(URI.create("http://example.org/"))
		.build();
var body = client
		.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofString())
		.body();
```

=== Parsing Data

Java has out-of-the-box support for:

* XML

😬

Clearly room for improvement!

=== Representing Data

Records make simple types simple:

```java
record Transaction(
	LocalDate date,
	long cents,
	TransactionType type) { }

enum TransactionType { PRIVATE, BUSINESS }
```

=== Processing Data

`for`-loops, `if` statements, etc. are simplest.

But once functions are introduced, streams become available.

=== Visualization and Interaction

JavaFX is powerful but not simple to get started with:

* lacks beginner-level visualization tools
* doesn't make interactive media easy

=== Writing Data

NIO.2 makes writing data very simple:

```java
var analysis = "...";
var file = Path.of("analysis.txt");
Files.writeString(file, analysis);
```

=== Progression

Natural progression:

* start with simple terminal interaction
* use NIO.2 to read and write local data
* use HTTP/2 client to access remote data
* use records to model data
* use common statements to analyze data
* potentially upgrade to streams

Go into more OOP as problems get more complex.
