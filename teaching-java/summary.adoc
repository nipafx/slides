=== Starting Point

Take first steps in the playground.

To get started "for real":

* tools: JDK, text editor
* code: simple `main` and `IO`
* execution with `java Prog.java`

=== Progression

[%step]
* need arguments? ⇝ add `String[] args`
* need to organize code? ⇝ add methods
* need more functionality? ⇝ explore JDK APIs: +
  e.g. NIO.2 or HTTP/2 client
* need to capture data? ⇝ define records
* need shared state? ⇝ add fields
* need even more functionality? ⇝ explore simple libraries: +
  e.g. JavaFX for visualization
* need more structure? ⇝ split into multiple files
* even more ⇝ use visibility & packages

=== Progression

Java can do better is some areas:

* managing dependencies without build tool
* steering away from outdated APIs
* support more data formats out of the box
* simplify (data) visualization

=== Progression

At some point:

* a more powerful editor would be helpful ⇝ IDE
* testing or delivering becomes necessary ⇝ build tool

Welcome to full Java!
